<p>The chief writings of the Rev. <span class="smcap">Sydney Smith</span> are included in the original
English editions in eight octavo volumes. These are his “Two Volumes of Sermons,”
1809; the Collection of his “Works,” (embracing articles from the Edinburgh Review,
the Plymley Letters, and other Papers) 4 vols., 1839-40; a posthumous volume, “Sermons
preached at St. Paul’s,” &amp;c., 1846; “Elementary Sketches of Moral Philosophy, delivered
at the Royal Institution,” published in 1850. To these are to be added, “Letters on American
Debts,” 1843; “A Fragment on the Irish Roman Catholic Church,” 1845; Letters on
Railway Management and other topics to the Morning Chronicle; Articles in the Edinburgh
Review not collected in his “Works”; numerous Sketches and Essays printed in
the “Memoirs,” by his daughter, Lady Holland; and the extensive series of “Letters,”
edited by Mrs. Austin. These have mainly furnished the material of the present volume.
In the preparation of the Table Talk, Memoir, and Notes, many collateral sources have
been drawn upon.</p>

<p>The most important of Sydney Smith’s Writings will here be found given entire; while
the selection generally presents the most characteristic passages of his “Wit and Wisdom”
from the whole. Numerous Miscellanies, of much interest, are included which are not to
be met with in any previous collection of the author’s works.</p>

<h2>A FRAGMENTARY PROLOGUE.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“La bravoure est une qualité innée, on ne se la donne pas.”</div>
<div class="verse indent4"><span class="smcap">Napoleon I.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap large">Dr. Lingard</span>, when adverting to the sons of Henry II., and
their knightly practices, remarks that although chivalry was considered
the school of honor and probity, there was not overmuch
of those or of any other virtues to be found among the members
of the chivalrous orders. He names the vices that were more
common, as he thinks, and probably with some justice. Hallam,
on the other hand, looks on the institution of chivalry as the best
school of moral discipline in the Middle Ages: and as the great
and influential source of human improvement. “It preserved,”
he says, “an exquisite sense of honor, which in its results worked
as great effects as either of the powerful spirits of liberty and religion,
which have given a predominant impulse to the moral sentiments
and energies of mankind.”</p>

<p>The custom of receiving arms at the age of manhood is supposed,
by the same author, to have been established among the nations
that overthrew the Roman Empire; and he cites the familiar passage
from Tacitus, descriptive of this custom among the Germans.
At first, little but bodily strength seems to have been required on
the part of the candidate. The qualifications and the forms of
investiture changed or improved with the times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>In a general sense, chivalry, according to Hallam, may be referred
to the age of Charlemagne, when the Caballarii, or horsemen,
became the distinctive appellation of those feudal tenants
and allodial proprietors who were bound to serve on horseback.
When these were equipped and formally appointed to their martial
duties, they were, in point of fact, knights, with so far more
incentives to distinction than modern soldiers, that each man depended
on himself, and not on the general body. Except in certain
cases, the individual has now but few chances of distinction; and
knighthood, in its solitary aspect, may be said to have been blown
up by gunpowder.</p>

<p>As examples of the true knightly spirit in ancient times, Mr.
Hallam cites Achilles, who had a supreme indifference for the
question of what side he fought upon, had a strong affection for a
friend, and looked at death calmly. I think Mr. Hallam over-rates
the bully Greek considerably. His instance of the Cid Ruy
Diaz, as a perfect specimen of what the modern knight ought to
have been, is less to be gainsaid.</p>

<p>In old times, as in later days, there were knights who acquired
the appellation by favor rather than service; or by a compelled
rather than a voluntary service. The old landholders, the Caballarii,
or Milites, as they came to be called, were landholders who
followed their lord to the field, by feudal obligation: paying their
rent, or part of it, by such service. The voluntary knights were
those “younger brothers,” perhaps, who sought to amend their
indifferent fortunes by joining the banner of some lord. These
were not legally knights, but they might win the honor by their
prowess; and thus in arms, dress, and title, the younger brother
became the equal of the wealthy landholders. He became even
their superior, in one sense, for as Mr. Hallam adds:—“The
territorial knights became by degrees ashamed of assuming a title
which the others had won by merit, till they themselves could
challenge it by real desert.”</p>

<p>The connection of knighthood with feudal tenure was much
loosened, if it did not altogether disappear, by the Crusades.
There the knights were chiefly volunteers who served for pay:
all feudal service there was out of the question. Its connection
with religion was, on the other hand, much increased, particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
among the Norman knights who had not hitherto, like the Anglo-Saxons,
looked upon chivalric investiture as necessarily a religious
ceremony. The crusaders made religious professors, at least, of
all knights, and never was one of these present at the reading
of the gospel, without holding the point of his sword toward the
book, in testimony of his desire to uphold what it taught by force
of arms. From this time the passage into knighthood was a solemn
ceremony; the candidate was belted, white-robed, and absolved
after due confession, when his sword was blessed, and
Heaven was supposed to be its director. With the love of God
was combined love for the ladies. What was implied was that
the knight should display courtesy, gallantry, and readiness to
defend, wherever those services were required by defenceless
women. Where such was bounden duty—but many knights did
not so understand it—there was an increase of refinement in
society; and probably there is nothing overcharged in the old
ballad which tells us of a feast at Perceforest, where eight hundred
knights sat at a feast, each of them with a lady at his side,
eating off the same plate; the then fashionable sign of a refined
friendship, mingled with a spirit of gallantry. That the husbands
occasionally looked with uneasiness upon this arrangement, is illustrated
in the unreasonably jealous husband in the romance of
“Lancelot du Lac;” but, as the lady tells him, he had little right
to cavil at all, for it was an age since any knight had eaten with
her off the same plate.</p>

<p>Among the Romans the word <i>virtue</i> implied both virtue and
valor—as if bravery in a man were the same thing as virtue in
a woman. It certainly did not signify among Roman knights that
a brave man was necessarily virtuous. In more recent times the
word gallantry has been made also to take a double meaning, implying
not only courage in man, but his courtesy toward woman.
Both in ancient and modern times, however, the words, or their
meanings, have been much abused. At a more recent period,
perhaps, gallantry was never better illustrated than when in an
encounter by hostile squadrons near Cherbourg, the adverse factions
stood still, on a knight, wearing the colors of his mistress,
advancing from the ranks of one party, and challenging to single
combat the cavalier in the opposite ranks who was the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
deeply in love with his mistress. There was no lack of adversaries,
and the amorous knights fell on one another with a fury
little akin to love.</p>

<p>A knight thus slain for his love was duly honored by his lady
and contemporaries. Thus we read in the history of Gyron le
Courtois, that the chivalric king so named, with his royal cousin
Melyadus, a knight, by way of equerry, and a maiden, went together
in search of the body of a chevalier who had fallen <i>pour
les beaux yeux</i> of that very lady. They found the body picturesquely
disposed in a pool of blood, the unconscious hand still
grasping the hilt of the sword that had been drawn in honor of
the maiden. “Ah, beauteous friend!” exclaims the lady, “how
dearly hast thou paid for my love! The good and the joy we
have shared have only brought thee death. Beauteous friend,
courteous and wise, valiant, heroic, good knight in every guise,
since thou has lost thy youth for me in this manner, in this strait,
and in this agony, as it clearly appears, what else remains for me
to suffer for thy sake, unless that I should keep you company?
Friend, friend, thy beauty has departed for the love of me, thy
flesh lies here bloody. Friend, friend, we were both nourished
together. I knew not what love was when I gave my heart to
love thee,” &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. “Young friend,” continues the lady,
“thou wert my joy and my consolation: for to see thee and to
speak to thee alone were sufficient to inspire joy, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.
Friend, what I behold slays me, I feel that death is within my
heart.” The lady then took up the bloody sword, and requested
Melyadus to look after the honorable interment of the knight on
that spot, and that he would see her own body deposited by her
“friend’s” side, in the same grave. Melyadus expressed great
astonishment at the latter part of the request, but as the lady insisted
that her hour was at hand, he promised to fulfil all her
wishes. Meanwhile the maiden knelt by the side of the dead
knight, held his sword to her lips, and gently died upon his breast.
Gyron said it was the wofullest sight that eye had ever beheld;
but all courteous as Gyron was, and he was so to such a remarkable
degree that he derived a surname from his courtesy, I say
that in spite of his sympathy and gallantry, he appears to have
had a quick eye toward making such profit as authors could make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
in those days, from ready writing upon subjects of interest. Before
another word was said touching the interment of the two
lovers, Gyron intimated that he would write a ballad upon them
that should have a universal circulation, and be sung in all lands
where there were gentle hearts and sweet voices. Gyron performed
what he promised, and the ballad of “Absdlon and Cesala,”
serves to show what very rough rhymes the courteous poet could
employ to illustrate a romantic incident. Let it be added that,
however the knights may sometimes have failed in their truth,
this was very rarely the case with the ladies. When Jordano
Bruno was received in his exile by Sir Philip Sidney, he requited
the hospitality by dedicating a poem to the latter. In this dedication,
he says: “With one solitary exception, all misfortunes that
flesh is heir to have been visited on me. I have tasted every kind
of calamity but one, that of finding false a woman’s love.”</p>

<p>It was not every knight that could make such an exception.
Certainly not that pearl of knights, King Arthur himself.
What a wife had that knight in the person of Guinever? Nay,
he is said to have had three wives of that name, and that all of
them were as faithless as ladies well <i>could</i> be. Some assert that
the described deeds of these three are in fact but the evil-doings
of one. However this may be, I may observe summarily here
what I have said in reference to Guinever in another place. With
regard to this triple-lady, the very small virtue of one third of the
whole will not salubriously leaven the entire lump. If romance
be true, and there is more about the history of Guinever than any
other lady—she was a delicious, audacious, winning, seductive,
irresistible, and heartless hussy; and a shameless! and a barefaced!
Only read “Sir Lancelot du Lac!” Yes, it can not be
doubted but that in the voluminous romances of the old day, there
was a sprinkling of historical facts. Now, if a thousandth part of
what is recorded of this heart-bewitching Guinever be true, she
must have been such a lady as we can not now conceive of. True
daughter of her mother Venus, when a son of Mars was not at
hand, she could stoop to Mulciber. If the king was not at home,
she could listen to a knight. If both were away, esquire or page
might speak boldly without fear of being unheeded; and if all
were absent, in the chase, or at the fray, there was always a good-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
groom in the saddle-room with whom Guinever could converse,
without holding that so to do was anything derogatory. I
know no more merry reading than that same ton-weight of
romance which goes by the name of “Sir Lancelot du Lac.” But
it is not of that sort which Mrs. Chapone would recommend to
young ladies, or that Dr. Cumming would read aloud in the Duke
of Argyll’s drawing-room. It is a book, however, which a grave
man a little tired of his gravity, may look into between serious
studies and solemn pursuits—a book for a lone winter evening by
a library-fire, with wine and walnuts at hand; or for an old-fashioned
summer’s evening, in a bower through whose foliage the sun
pours his <i>adieu</i>, as gorgeously red as the Burgundy in your flask.
Of a truth, a man must be “in a concatenation accordingly,” ere
he may venture to address himself to the chronicle which tells of
the “bamboches,” “fredaines,” and “bombances,” of Guinever the
Frail, and of Lancelot du Lac.</p>

<p>We confess to having more regard for Arthur than for his
triple-wife Guinever. As I have had occasion to say in other
pages, “I do not like to give up Arthur!” I love the name, the
hero, and his romantic deeds. I deem lightly of his light o’love
bearing. Think of his provocation both ways! Whatever the
privilege of chivalry may have been, it was the practice of too
many knights to be faithless. They vowed fidelity, but they were
a promise-breaking, word-despising crew. On this point I am
more inclined to agree with Dr. Lingard than with Mr. Hallam.
Honor was ever on their lips, but not always in their hearts, and
it was little respected by them, when found in the possession of
their neighbor’s wives. How does Scott consider them in this
respect, when in describing a triad of knights, he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“There were two who loved their neighbor’s wives,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And one who loved his own.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet how is it that knights are so invariably mentioned with long-winded
laudation by Romish writers—always excepting Lingard—when
they desire to illustrate the devoted spirit of olden times?
Is it that the knights were truthful, devout, chaste, God-fearing?
not a jot! Is it because the cavaliers cared but for one thing, in
the sense of having fear but for one thing, and <i>that</i> the devil?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
To escape from being finally triumphed over by the Father of
Evil, they paid largely, reverenced outwardly, confessed unreservedly,
and were absolved plenarily. That is the reason why
chivalry was patted on the back by Rome. At the same time we
must not condemn a system, the principles of which were calculated
to work such extensive ameliorations in society as chivalry.
Christianity itself might be condemned were we to judge of it by
the shortcomings of its followers.</p>

<p>But even Mr. Hallam is compelled at last, reluctantly, to confess
that the morals of chivalry were not pure. After all his praise
of the system, he looks at its literature, and with his eye resting
on the tales and romances written for the delight and instruction
of chivalric ladies and gentlemen, he remarks that the “violation
of marriage vows passes in them for an incontestable privilege of
the brave and the fair; and an accomplished knight seems
to have enjoyed as undoubted prerogatives, by general consent of
opinion, as were claimed by the brilliant courtiers of Louis XV.”
There was an especial reason for this, the courtiers of Louis XV.
might be anything they chose, provided that with gallantry they
were loyal, courteous, and munificent. Now loyalty, courtesy, and
that prodigality which goes by the name of munificence, were exactly
the virtues that were deemed most essential to chivalry.
But these were construed by the old knights as they were by the
more modern courtiers. The first took advantages in combat that
would now be deemed disloyal by any but a Muscovite. The
second would cheat at cards in the gaming saloons of Versailles,
while they would run the men through who spoke lightly of their
descent. So with regard to courtesy, the knight was full of
honeyed phrases to his equals and superiors, but was as coarsely
arrogant as Menschikoff to an inferior. In the same way, Louis
XIV., who would never pass one of his own scullery-maids without
raising his plumed beaver, could address terms to the ladies
of his court, which, but for the sacred majesty which was supposed
to environ his person, might have purchased for him a severe castigation.
Then consider the case of that “first gentleman in Europe,”
George, Prince of Wales: he really forfeited his right to
the throne by marrying a Catholic lady, Mrs. Fitzherbert, and he
freed himself unscrupulously from the scrape by uttering a lie.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
And so again with munificence; the greater part of these knights
and courtiers were entirely thoughtless of the value of money.
At the Field of the Cloth of Gold, for instance, whole estates
were mortgaged or sold, in order that the owners might outshine
all competitors in the brilliancy and quality of their dress. This
sort of extravagance makes one man look glad and all his relatives
rueful. The fact is that when men thus erred, it was for want of
observance of a Christian principle; and if men neglect that observance,
it is as little in the power of chivalry as of masonry to
mend him. There was “a perfect idea” of chivalry, indeed, but
if any knight ever realized it in his own person, he was, simply,
nearly a perfect Christian, and would have been still nearer to
perfection in the latter character if he had studied the few simple
rules of the system of religion rather than the stilted and unsteady
ones of romance. The study of the latter, at all events,
did not prevent, but in many instances caused a dissoluteness of
manners, a fondness for war rather than peace, and a wide distinction
between classes, making aristocrats of the few, and villains of
the many.</p>

<p>Let me add here, as I have been speaking of the romance of
“Lancelot du Lac,” that I quite agree with Montluc, who after
completing his chronicle of the History of France, observed that
it would be found more profitable reading than either Lancelot or
Amadis. La Noue especially condemns the latter as corrupting
the manners of the age. Southey, again, observes that these
chivalric romances acquired their poison in France or in Italy.
The Spanish and Portuguese romances he describes as free from
all taint. In the Amadis the very well-being of the world is made
to rest upon chivalry. “What would become of the world,” it is
asked in the twenty-second book of the Amadis, “if God did not
provide for the defence of the weak and helpless against unjust
usurpers? And how could provision be made, if good knights
were satisfied to do nothing else but sit in chamber with the ladies?
What would then the world become, but a vast community of
brigands?”</p>

<p>Lamotte Levayer was of a different opinion. “Les armes,” he
says, when commenting upon chivalry and arms generally; “Les
armes detruisent tous les arts excepté ceux qui favorisent la gloire.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
In Germany, too, where chivalry was often turned to the oppression
of the weak rather than employed for their protection, the
popular contempt and dread of “knightly principles” were early
illustrated in the proverb, “Er will Ritter an mir werden,” He
wants to play the knight over me. In which proverb, knight
stands for oppressor or insulter. In our own country the order
came to be little cared for, but on different grounds.</p>

<p>Dr. Nares in his “Heraldic Anomalies,” deplores the fact that
mere knighthood has fallen into contempt. He dates this from
the period when James I. placed baronets above knights. The
hereditary title became a thing to be coveted, but knights who
were always held to be knights bachelors, could not of course bequeath
a title to child or children who were not supposed in heraldry
to exist. The Doctor quotes Sir John Ferne, to show that
Olibion, the son of Asteriel, of the line of Japhet, was the first
knight ever created. The personage in question was sent forth to
battle, after his sire had smitten him lightly nine times with Japhet’s
falchion, forged before the flood. There is little doubt but
that originally a knight was simply <i>Knecht</i>, servant of the king.
Dr. Nares says that the Thanes were so in the north, and that
these, although of gentle blood, exercised the offices even of
cooks and barbers to the royal person. But may not these offices
have been performed by the “unter Thans,” or deputies? I shall
have occasion to observe, subsequently, on the law which deprived
a knight’s descendants of his arms, if they turned merchants; but
in Saxon times it is worthy of observation, that if a merchant
made three voyages in one of his own ships, he was thenceforward
the Thane’s right-worthy, or equal.</p>

<p>Among the Romans a blow on the ear gave the slave freedom.
Did the blow on the shoulder given to a knight make a free-servant
of him? Something of the sort seems to have been intended.
The title was doubtless mainly but not exclusively military. To
dub, from the Saxon word <i>dubban</i>, was either to gird or put on,
“don,” or was to <i>strike</i>, and perhaps both may be meant, for the
knight was girt with spurs, as well as stricken, or <i>geschlagen</i> as
the German term has it.</p>

<p>There was striking, too, at the unmaking of a knight. His
heels were then degraded of their spurs, the latter being beaten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
or chopped away. “His heels deserved it,” says Bertram of the
cowardly Parolles, “his heels deserved it for usurping of his spurs
so long.” The sword, too, on such occasions, was broken.</p>

<p>Fuller justly says that “the plainer the coat is, the more ancient
and honorable.” He adds, that “two colors are necessary and
most highly honorable: three are very highly honorable; <i>four</i>
commendable; <i>five</i> excusable; more disgraceful.” He must have
been a gastronomic King-at-Arms, who so loaded a “coat” with
fish, flesh, and fowl, that an observer remarked, “it was well
victualled enough to stand a siege.” <i>Or</i> is the richest coloring,
but, as Fuller again says, “Herbs <i>vert</i>, being natural, are better
than <i>Or</i>.” He describes a “<i>Bend</i> as the best <i>ordinary</i>, being a
belt athwart,” but a coat bruised with a bar sinister is hardly a
distinction to be proud of. If the heralds of George the Second’s
time looked upon that monarch as the son of Count Königsmark,
as Jacobite-minded heralds may have been malignant enough to
do, they no doubt mentally drew the degrading bar across the
royal arms, and tacitly denied the knighthood conferred by what
they, in such foolish case, would have deemed an illegitimate hand.</p>

<p>Alluding to reasons for some bearings, Fuller tells us that,
“whereas the Earls of Oxford anciently gave their ‘coats’ plain,
quarterly <i>gules</i> and <i>or</i>, they took afterward in the first a <i>mullet</i> or
<i>star-argent</i>, because the chief of the house had a falling-star, as
it was said, alighting on his shield as he was fighting in the Holy
Land.”</p>

<p>It is to be observed that when treating of precedency, Fuller
places knights, or “soldiers” with seamen, civilians, and physicians,
and after saints, confessors, prelates, statesmen, and judges.
Knights and physicians he seems to have considered as equally
terrible to life; but in his order of placing he was led by no particular
principle, for among the lowest he places “learned writers,”
and “benefactors to the public.” He has, indeed, one principle,
as may be seen, wherein he says, “I place first princes, good manners
obliging all other persons to follow them, as religion obliges
me to follow God’s example by a royal recognition of that original
precedency, which he has granted to his vicegerents.”</p>

<p>The Romans are said to have established the earliest known
order of knighthood; and the members at one time wore rings, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
a mark of distinction, as in later times knights wore spurs. The
knights of the Holy Roman Empire were members of a modern
order, whose sovereigns are not, what they would have themselves
considered, descendants of the Cæsars. If we only knew what
our own Round Table was, and where it stood, we should be enabled
to speak more decisively upon the question of the chevaliers
who sat around it. But it is undecided whether the table was not
really a house. At it, or in it, the knights met during the season
of Pentecost, but whether the assembly was collected at Winchester
or Windsor no one seems able to determine; and he would
impart no particularly valuable knowledge even if he could.</p>

<p>Knighthood was a sort of nobility worth having, for it testified
to the merit of the wearer. An inherited title should, indeed,
compel him who succeeds to it, to do nothing to disgrace it: but
preserving the lustre is not half so meritorious as creating it.
<i>Knights bachelors</i> were so called because the distinction was conferred
for some act of <i>personal</i> courage, to reward for which the
offspring of the knight could make no claim. He was, in this respect,
to them as though he had been never married. The knight
bachelor was a truly proud man. The word <i>knecht</i> simply implied
a servant, sworn to continue good service in honor of the sovereign,
and of God and St. George. “I remain your sworn servant”
is a form of epistolary valediction which crept into the letters
of other orders in later times. The manner of making was more
theatrical than at the present time; and we should now smile if
we were to see, on a lofty scaffold in St. Paul’s, a city gentleman
seated in a chair of silver adorned with green silk, undergoing exhortation
from the bishop, and carried up between two lords, to be
dubbed under the sovereign’s hand, a good knight, by the help of
Heaven and his patron saint.</p>

<p>In old days belted earls could create knights. In modern times,
the only subject who is legally entitled to confer the honor of
chivalry is the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; and some of his
“subjects” consider it the most terrible of his privileges. The attempt
to dispute the right arose, perhaps, from those who dreaded
the exercise of it on themselves. However this may be, it is certain
that the <i>vexata questio</i> was finally set at rest in 1823, when
the judges declared that the power in question undoubtedly resided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
in the Lords Lieutenant, since the Union, as it did in the viceroys
who reigned vicariously previous to that period. According to
the etiquette of heraldry, the distinctive appellation “Sir” should
never be omitted even when the knight is a noble of the first hereditary
rank. “The Right Honorable Sir Hugh Percy, Duke
of Northumberland,” would have been the proper heraldic defining
of his grace when he became Knight of the Garter, for it is a rule
that “the greater dignity doth never drown the lesser, but both
stand together in one person.”</p>

<p>A knight never surrendered his sword but to a knight. “Are
you knight and gentleman?” asked Suffolk, when, four hundred
years ago, he yielded to Regnault: “I am a gentleman,” said
Regnault, “but I am not yet a knight.” Whereupon Suffolk bade
him kneel, dubbed him knight, received the accustomed oaths, and
then gave up his old sword to the new chevalier.</p>

<p>Clark considered that the order was degraded from its exclusively
military character, when membership was conferred upon
gownsmen, physician, burghers, and artists. He considered that
civil merit, so distinguished, was a loss of reputation to military
knights. The logic by which he arrives at such a conclusion is
rather of the loosest. It may be admitted, however, that the matter
has been specially abused in Germany. Monsieur About, that
clever gentleman, who wrote “Tolla” out of somebody else’s book,
very pertinently remarks in his review of the fine-art department
of the Paris Exhibition, that the difference between English and
German artists is, that the former are well-paid, but that very few
of them are knights, while the latter are ill-paid and consequently
ill-clothed; but, for lack of clothes, have abundance of ribands.</p>

<p>Dr. Nares himself is of something of the opinion of Clark, and
he ridicules the idea of a chivalric and martial title being given to
brewers, silversmiths, attorneys, apothecaries, upholsterers, hosiers,
tailors. &amp;c. He asserts that knighthood should belong only to
military members: but of these no inconsiderable number would
have to be unknighted, or would have to wait an indefinite time
for the honor were the old rule strictly observed, whereby no man
was entitled to the rank and degree of knighthood, who had not
actually been in battle and captured a prisoner with his own
hands. With respect to the obligation on knights to defend and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
maintain all ladies, gentlewomen, widows, and orphans; the one
class of men may be said to be just as likely to fulfil this obligation,
as the other class.</p>

<p>France, Italy, and Germany, long had their forensic knights,
certain titles at the bar giving equal privileges; and the obligations
above alluded to were supposed to be observed by these
knights—who found esquires in their clerks, in the forensic war
which they were for ever waging in defence of right. Unhappily
these forensic chevaliers so often fought in defence of wrong and
called it right, that the actual duty was indiscriminately performed
or neglected.</p>

<p>It has often been said of “orders” that they are indelible. However
this may be with the clergy, it is especially the case with
knights. To whatever title a knight might attain, duke, earl, or
baron, he never ceased to be a knight. In proof too that the latter
title was considered one of augmentation, is cited the case of Louis
XI., who, at his coronation, was knighted by Philip, Duke of Burgundy.
“If Louis,” says an eminent writer (thus cited by Dr.
Nares), “had been made duke, marquis, or earl, it would have
detracted from him, all those titles being in himself.”</p>

<p>The crown, when it stood in need of the chivalrous arms of its
knights, called for the required feudal service, not from its earls
as such, but from its barons. To every earldom was annexed a
barony, whereby their feudal service with its several dependent
duties was alone ascertained. “That is,” says Berington, in his
Henry II., “the tenure of barony and not of earldom constituted
the legal vassal of the crown. Each earl was at the same time a
baron, as were the bishops and some abbots and priors of orders.”</p>

<p>Some of these barons were the founders of parish churches, but
the terms on which priest and patron occasionally lived may be
seen in the law, whereby patrons or feudatarii killing the rector,
vicar, or clerk of their church, or mutilating him, were condemned
to lose their rights; and their posterity, to the fourth generation,
was made incapable of benefice or prelacy in religious houses.
The knightly patron was bound to be of the same religious opinions,
of course, as his priest, or his soul had little chance of being
prayed for. In later times we have had instances of patrons determining
the opinions of the minister. Thus as a parallel, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
rather in contrast with measures as they stood between Sir Knight
and Sir Priest, may be taken a passage inserted in the old deeds
of the Baptist chapel at Oulney. In this deed the managers or
trustees injoined that “no person shall ever be chosen pastor of
this church, who shall differ in his religious sentiments from the
Rev. John Gibbs of Newcastle.” It is rather a leap to pass thus
from the baronial knights to the Baptist chapels, but the matter
has to do with my subject at both extremities. Before leaving it
I will notice the intimation proudly made on the tombstone in
Bunhill Fields Cemetery, of Dame Mary Page, relict of Sir
George Page. The lady died more than a century and a quarter
ago, and although the stone bears no record of any virtue save
that she was patient and fearless under suffering, it takes care to
inform all passers-by, that this knight’s lady, “in sixty-seven
months was tapped sixty-six times, and had taken away two hundred
and forty gallons of water, without ever repining at her case,
or ever fearing its operation.” I prefer the mementoes of knight’s
ladies in olden times which recorded their deeds rather than their
diseases, and which told of them, as White said of Queen Mary,
that their “knees were hard with kneeling.”</p>

<p>I will add one more incident, before changing the topic, having
reference as it has to knights, maladies, and baptism. In 1660,
Sir John Floyer was the most celebrated knight-physician of his
day. He chiefly tilted against the disuse of baptismal immersion.
He did not treat the subject theologically, but in a sanitary point
of view. He prophesied that England would return to the practice
as soon as people were convinced that cold baths were safe
and useful. He denounced the first innovators who departed from
immersion, as the destroyers of the health of their children and of
posterity. Degeneracy of race, he said, had followed, hereditary
diseases increased, and men were mere carpet-knights unable to
perform such lusty deeds as their duly-immersed forefathers.</p>

<p>There are few volumes which so admirably illustrate what
knights <i>should</i> be, and what they sometimes were <i>not</i>, as De Joinville’s
Chronicle of the Crusades of St. Louis—that St. Louis,
who was himself the patron-saint of an order, the cross of which
was at first conferred on princes, and at last on perruquiers. The
faithful chronicler rather profanely, indeed, compares the royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
knight with God himself. “As God died for his people, so did
St. Louis often peril his life, and incurred the greatest dangers, for
the people of his kingdom.” After all, this simile is as lame as it
is profane. The truth, nevertheless, as it concerns St. Louis, is
creditable to the illustrious king, saint, and chevalier. “In his
conversation he was remarkably chaste, for I never heard him, at
any time, utter an indecent word, nor make use of the devil’s
name; which, however, now is very commonly uttered by every
one, but which I firmly believe, is so far from being agreeable to
God, that it is highly displeasing to him.” The King St. Louis,
mixed water with his wine, and tried to force his knights to follow
his example, adding, that “it was a beastly thing for an honorable
man to make himself drunk.” This was a wise maxim, and one
naturally held by a son, whose mother had often declared to him,
that “she would rather he was in his grave, than that he should
commit a mortal sin.” And yet wise as his mother, and wise as
her son was, the one could not give wise religious instructors to
the latter, nor the latter perceive where their instruction was illogical.
That it <i>was</i> so, may be discerned in the praise given by De
Joinville, to the fact, that the knightly king in his dying moments
“called upon God and his saints, and <i>especially</i> upon St. James,
and St. Genevieve, <i>as his intercessors</i>.”</p>

<p>It is interesting to learn from such good authority as De Joinville,
the manner in which the knights who followed St. Louis
prepared themselves for their crusading mission. “When I was
ready to set out, I sent for the Abbot of Cheminon, who was at
that time considered as the most discreet man of all the White
Monks, to reconcile myself with him. He gave me my scarf, and
bound it on me, and likewise put the pilgrim’s staff in my hand.
Instantly after I quitted the castle of Joinville, without even re-entering
it until my return from beyond sea. I made pilgrimages
to all the holy places in the neighborhood, such as Bliecourt, St.
Urban, and others near to Joinville. I dared never turn my eyes
that way, for fear of feeling too great regret, and lest my courage
should fail on leaving my two fine children, and my fair castle of
Joinville, which I loved in my heart.” “One touch of nature
makes the whole world kin,” and here we have the touch the poet
speaks of. Down the Saône and subsequently down the Rhone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
the crusaders flock in ample vessels, but not large enough to contain
their steeds, which were led by grooms along the banks. When all
had re-embarked at Marseilles and were fairly out at sea, “the captain
made the priests and clerks mount to the castle of the ship, and
chant psalms in praise of God, that he might be pleased to grant
us a prosperous voyage.” While they were singing the <i>Veni
Creator</i> in full chorus, the mariners set the sails “in the name of
God,” and forthwith a favorable breeze sprang up in answer to
the appeal, and knights and holy men were speedily careering
over the billows of the open sea very hopeful and exceedingly
sick. “I must say here,” says De Joinville, who was frequently
so disturbed by the motion of the vessel, so little of a knight, and
so timid on the water as to require a couple of men to hold him as
he leant over the side in the helpless and unchivalrous attitude of
a cockney landsman on board a Boulogne steamer—“I must say,”
he exclaims—sick at the very reminiscence, “that he is a great
fool who shall put himself in such dangers, having wronged any
one, or having any mortal sins on his conscience; for when he
goes to sleep in the evening, he knows not if in the morning he
may not find himself under the sea.”</p>

<p>This was a pious reflection, and it was such as many a knight,
doubtless, made on board a vessel, on the castle of which priests
and clerks sang <i>Veni Creator</i> and the mariners bent the sail “in
the name of God.” But whether the holy men did not act up to
their profession, or the secular knights cared not to profit by their
example, certain it is that in spite of the saintly services and formalities
on board ship, the chevaliers were no sooner on shore,
than they fell into the very worst of practices. De Joinville,
speaking of them at Damietta, remarks that the barons, knights,
and others, who ought to have practised self-denial and economy,
were wasteful of their means, prodigal of their supplies, and addicted
to banquetings, and to the vices which attend on over-luxuriant
living. There was a general waste of everything, health
included. The example set by the knights was adopted by the
men-at-arms, and the debauchery which ensued was terrific. The
men were reduced to the level of beasts, and wo to the women or
girls who fell into their power when out marauding. It is singular
to find De Joinville remarking that the holy king was obliged “to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
wink at the greatest liberties of his officers and men.” The picture
of a royal saint winking at lust, rapine, and murder, is not an
agreeable one. “The good king was told,” says the faithful chronicler,
“that at a stone’s throw round his own pavilion, were several
tents whose owners made profit by letting them out for infamous purposes.”
These tents and tabernacles of iniquity were kept by the
king’s own personal attendants, and yet the royal saint winked at
them! The licentiousness was astounding, the more so as it was
practised by Christian knights, who were abroad on a holy purpose,
but who went with bloody hands, unclean thoughts, and spiritual
songs to rescue the Sepulchre of Christ from the unworthy keeping
of the infidel. Is it wonderful that the enterprise was ultimately
a failure?</p>

<p>De Joinville himself, albeit purer of life than many of his comrades,
was not above taking unmanly advantage of a foe. The
rule of chivalry, which directed that all should be fair in fight,
was never regarded by those chivalrous gentlemen when victory
was to be obtained by violating the law. Thus, of an affair on the
plains before Babylon, we find the literary swordsman complacently
recording that he “perceived a sturdy Saracen mounting his horse,
which was held by one of his esquires by the bridle, and <i>while he
was putting his hand on his saddle to mount</i>, I gave him,” says
De Joinville, “such a thrust with my spear, which I pushed as
far as I was able, that he fell down dead.” This was a base and
cowardly action. There was more of the chivalrous in what followed:
“The esquire, seeing his lord dead, abandoned master
and horse; but, watching my motions, on my return struck me
with his lance such a blow between my shoulders as drove me on
my horse’s neck, and held me there so tightly that I could not
draw my sword, which was girthed round me. I was forced to
draw another sword which was at the pommel of my saddle, and
it was high time; but when he saw I had my sword in my hand,
he withdrew his lance, which I had seized, and ran from me.”</p>

<p>I have said that this knight who took such unfair advantage of a
foe, was more of a Christian nevertheless than many of his fellows.
This is illustrated by another trait highly illustrative of the principles
which influenced those brave and pious warriors. De Joinville
remarks that on the eve of Shrove-tide, 1249, he saw a thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
which he “<i>must</i> relate.” On the vigil of that day, he tells us,
there died a very valiant and prudent knight, Sir Hugh de Landricourt,
a follower of De Joinville’s own banner. The burial service
was celebrated; but half-a-dozen of De Joinville’s knights,
who were present as mourners, talked so irreverently loud that the
priest was disturbed as he was saying mass. Our good chronicler
went over to them, reproved them, and informed them that “it was
unbecoming gentlemen thus to talk while the mass was celebrating.”
The ungodly half-dozen, thereupon, burst into a roar of laughter,
and informed De Joinville, in their turn, that they were discussing
as to which of the six should marry the widow of the defunct Sir
Hugh, then lying before them on his bier! De Joinville, with
decency and common sense “rebuked them sharply, and said such
conversation was indecent and improper, for that they had too soon
forgotten their companion.” From this circumstance De Joinville
tries to draw a logical inference, if not conclusion. He makes a
sad confusion of causes and effects, rewards and punishments,
practice and principle, human accidents and especial interferences
on the part of Heaven. For instance, after narrating the mirth
of the knights at the funeral of Sir Hugh, and their disputing as
to which of them should woo the widow, he adds: “Now it happened
on the morrow, when the first grand battle took place,
although we may laugh at their follies, that of all the six not one
escaped death, and they remained unburied. The wives of the
whole six re-married! <i>This</i> makes it credible that God leaves no
such conduct unpunished. With regard to myself <i>I fared little
better</i>, for I was grievously wounded in the battle of Shrove Tuesday.
I had besides the disorder in my legs and mouth before
spoken of, and such a rheum in my head it ran through my mouth
and nostrils. In addition I had a double fever called a quartan,
from which God defend us! And with these illnesses was I confined
to my bed for half of Lent.” And thus, if the married knights
were retributively slain for talking about the wooing of a comrade’s
widow, so De Joinville himself was somewhat heavily afflicted for
having undertaken to reprove them! I must add one more incident,
however, to show how in the battle-field the human and
Christian principle was not altogether lost.</p>

<p>The poor priest, whom the wicked and wedded knights had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
interrupted in the service of the mass by follies, at which De Joinville
himself seems to think that men <i>may</i>, perhaps, be inclined to
laugh, became as grievously ill as De Joinville himself. “And
one day,” says the latter, “when he was singing mass before me
as I lay in my bed, at the moment of the elevation of the host
I saw him so exceedingly weak that he was near fainting; but
when I perceived he was on the point of falling to the ground, I
flung myself out of bed, sick as I was, and taking my coat, embraced
him, and bade him be at his ease, and take courage from
Him whom he held in his hand. He recovered some little; but I
never quitted him till he had finished the mass, which he completed,
and this was the last, for he never celebrated another, but died;
God receive his soul!” This is a pleasanter picture of Christian
chivalry than any other that is given by this picturesque chronicler.</p>

<p>Chivalry, generally, has been more satirized and sneered at by
the philosophers than by any other class of men. The sages
stigmatize the knights as mere boasters of bravery, and in some
such terms as those used by Dussaute, they assert that the boasters
of their valor are as little to be trusted as those who boast of their
probity. “Defiez vous de quiconque parle toujours de sa probité
comme de quiconque parle toujours de bravoure.”</p>

<p>It will not, however, do for the philosophers to sneer at their
martial brethren. Now that Professor Jacobi has turned from
grave studies for the benefit of mankind, to the making of infernal
machines for the destruction of brave and helpless men, at a distance,
that very unsuccessful but would-be homicide has, as far as
he himself is concerned, reduced science to a lower level than that
occupied by men whose trade is arms. But this is not the first
time that philosophers have mingled in martial matters. The
very war which has been begun by the bad ambition of Russia,
may be traced to the evil officiousness of no less a philosopher than
Leibnitz. It was this celebrated man who first instigated a European
monarch to seize upon a certain portion of the Turkish
dominion, whereby to secure an all but universal supremacy.</p>

<p>The monarch was Louis XIV., to whom Leibnitz addressed
himself, in a memorial, as to the wisest of sovereigns, most worthy
to have imparted to him a project at once the most holy, the most
just, and the most easy of accomplishment. Success, adds the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
philosopher, would secure to France the empire of the seas and
of commerce, and make the French king the supreme arbiter of
Christendom. Leibnitz at once names Egypt as the place to be
seized upon; and after hinting what was necessary, by calling his
majesty a “miracle of secresy,” he alludes to further achievements
by stating of the one in question, that it would cover his name
with an immortal glory, for having cleared, whether for himself
or his descendants, “the route for exploits similar to those of
Alexander.”</p>

<p>There is no country in the memorialist’s opinion the conquest
of which deserves so much to be attempted. As to any provocation
on the part of the Turkish sovereign of Egypt, he does not
pause to advise the king even to feign having received cause of
offence. The philosopher goes through a <i>resumé</i> of the history
of Egypt, and the successive conquests that had been made of, as
well as attempts against it, to prove that its possession was accounted
of importance in all times; and he adds that its Turkish master
was just then in such debility that France could not desire a more
propitious opportunity for invasion. This argument shows that
when the Czar Nicholas touched upon this nefarious subject, he
not only was ready to rob this same “sick man,” the Turk, but he
stole his arguments whereby to illustrate his opinions, and to prove
that his sentiments were well-founded.</p>

<p>“By a single fortunate blow,” says Leibnitz, “empires may be in
an instant overthrown and founded. In such wars are found the
elements of high power and of an exalted glory.” It is unnecessary
to repeat all the seductive terms which Leibnitz employs to
induce Louis XIV. to set his chivalry in motion against the Turkish
power. Egypt he calls “the eye of countries, the mother of
grain, the seat of commerce.” He hints that Muscovy was even
then ready to take advantage of any circumstance that might facilitate
her way to the conquest of Turkey. The conquest of
Egypt then was of double importance to France. Possessing
<i>that</i>, France would be mistress of the Mediterranean, of a great
part of Africa and Asia, and “the king of France could then, by
incontestable right, and with the consent of the Pope, assume the
title of Emperor of the East.” A further bait held out is, that in
such a position he could “hold the pontiffs much more in his power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
than if they resided at Avignon.” He sums up by saying that
there would be on the part of the human race, “an everlasting
reverence for the memory of the great king to whom so many
miracles were due!” “With the exception of the philosopher’s
stone,” finally remarks the philosopher, “I know nothing that can
be imagined of more importance than the conquest of Egypt.”</p>

<p>Leibnitz enters largely into the means to be employed, in order
to insure success; among them is a good share of mendacity; and
it must be acknowledged that the spirit of the memorial and its
objects, touching not Egypt alone, but the Turkish empire generally,
had been well pondered over by the Czar before he made
that felonious attempt in which he failed to find a confederate.</p>

<p>The original of the memorial, which is supposed to have been
presented to Louis XIV. just previous to his invasion of Holland—and,
as some say, more with the intention of diverting the king
from his attack on that country, than with any more definite
object—was preserved in the archives of Versailles till the period
of the great revolution. A copy in the handwriting of Leibnitz
was, however, preserved in the Library at Hanover. Its contents
were without doubt known to Napoleon when he was meditating
that Egyptian conquest which Leibnitz pronounced to be so easy
of accomplishment; a copy, made at the instance of Marshal Mortier
for the Royal Library in Paris, is now in that collection.</p>

<p>The suggestion of Leibnitz, that the seat, if not of universal
monarchy, at least of the mastership of Christendom, was in the
Turkish dominions, has never been forgotten by Russia; and it is
very possible that some of its seductive argument may have influenced
the Czar before he impelled his troops into that war,
which showed that Russia, with all its boasted power, could neither
take Silistria nor keep Sebastopol.</p>

<p>But in this fragmentary prologue, which began with Lingard
and ends with Leibnitz, we have rambled over wide ground.
Let us become more orderly, and look at those who were to be
made knights.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">I have</span> in another chapter noticed the circumstance of knighthood
conferred on an Irish prince, at so early an age as seven
years. This was the age at which, in less precocious England,
noble youths entered wealthy knights’ families as pages, to learn
obedience, to be instructed in the use of weapons, and to acquire
a graceful habit of tending on ladies. The poor nobility, especially,
found their account in this system, which gave a gratuitous education
to their sons, in return for services which were not considered
humiliating or dishonorable. These boys served seven years as
pages, or varlets—sometimes very impudent varlets—and at
fourteen might be regular esquires, and tend their masters where
hard blows were dealt and taken—for which encounters they
“riveted with a sigh the armor they were forbidden to wear.”</p>

<p>Neither pages, varlets, nor household, could be said to have been
always as roystering as modern romancers have depicted them.
There was at least exceptions to the rule—if there was a rule
of roystering. Occasionally, the lads were not indifferently taught
before they left their own homes. That is, not indifferently taught
for the peculiar life they were about to lead. Even the Borgias,
infamous as the name has become through inexorable historians
and popular operas, were at one time eminently respectable and
exemplarily religious. Thus in the household of the Duke of
Gandia, young Francis Borgia, his son, passed his time “among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
the domestics in wonderful innocence and piety.” It was the only
season of his life, however, so passed. Marchangy asserts that
the pages of the middle ages were often little saints; but this
could hardly have been the case since “espiègle comme un page,”
“hardi comme un page,” and other illustrative sayings have survived
even the era of pagedom. Indeed, if we may believe the
minstrels, and they were often as truth-telling as the annalist, the
pages were now and then even more knowing and audacious than
their masters. When the Count Ory was in love with the young
Abbess of Farmoutier, he had recourse to his page for counsel.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>How ready was the ecstatic young scamp with his reply:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Sire il faut prendre quatorze chevaliers,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>What came of this advice, the song tells in very joyous terms, for
which the reader may be referred to that grand collection the
“Chants et Chansons de la France.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mr. Kenelm Digby, who is, be it said in
passing, a painter of pages, looking at his object through pink-colored
glasses, thus writes of these young gentlemen, in his
“Mores Catholici.”</p>

<p>“Truly beautiful does the fidelity of chivalrous youth appear
in the page of history or romance. Every master of a family in
the middle ages had some young man in his service who would
have rejoiced to shed the last drop of his blood to save him, and
who, like Jonathan’s armor-bearer, would have replied to his summons:
‘Fac omnia quæ placent animo tuo; perge quo cupis; et
ero tecum ubicumque volueris.’ When Gyron le Courtois resolved
to proceed on the adventure of the <i>Passage perilleux</i>, we
read that the valet, on hearing the frankness and courtesy with
which his lord spoke to him, began to weep abundantly, and said,
all in tears, ‘Sire, know that my heart tells me that sooth, if you
proceed further, you will never return; that you will either perish
there, or you will remain in prison; but, nevertheless, nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
shall prevent me going with you. Better die with you, if it be
God’s will, than leave you in such guise to save my own life;’
and so saying, he stepped forward and said, ‘Sire, since you will
not return according to my advice, I will not leave you this time,
come to me what may.’ Authority in the houses of the middle
ages,” adds Mr. Digby, “was always venerable. The very term
<i>seneschal</i> is supposed to have implied ‘old knight,’ so that, as with
the Greeks, the word signifying ‘to honor,’ and to ‘pay respect,’
was derived immediately from that which denoted old age, <i>πρεσβευω</i>
being thus used in the first line of the Eumenides. Even to those
who were merely attached by the bonds of friendship or hospitality,
the same lessons and admonitions were considered due. John
Francis Picus of Mirandola mentions his uncle’s custom of frequently
admonishing his friends, and exhorting them to a holy life.
‘I knew a man,’ he says, ‘who once spoke with him on the subject
of manners, and who was so much moved by only two words from
him, which alluded to the death of Christ, as the motive for avoiding
sin, that from that hour, he renounced the ways of vice, and
reformed his whole life and manner.’”</p>

<p>We smile to find Mr. Digby mentioning the carving of angels
in stone over the castle-gates, as at Vincennes, as a proof that
the pages who loitered about there were little saints. But we
read with more interest, that “the Sieur de Ligny led Bayard
home with him, and in the evening preached to him as if he had
been his own son, recommending him to have heaven always before
his eyes.” This is good, and that it had its effect on Bayard,
we all know; nevertheless that chevalier himself was far from
perfect.</p>

<p>With regard to the derivation of <i>Seneschal</i> as noticed above,
we may observe that it implies “old man of skill.” Another word
connected with arms is “Marshal,” which is derived from <i>Mar</i>,
“a horse,” and <i>Schalk</i>, “skilful,” one knowing in horses; hence
“Maréchal ferrant,” as assumed by French farriers. <i>Schalk</i>,
however, I have seen interpreted as meaning “servant.” Earl
Marshal was, originally, the knight who looked after the royal
horses and stables, and all thereto belonging.</p>

<p>But to return to the subject of education. If all the sons of
noblemen, in former days, were as well off for gentle teachers as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
old historians and authors describe them to have been, they undoubtedly
had a great advantage over some of their descendants
of the present day. In illustration of this fact it is only necessary
to point to the sermons recently delivered by a reverend pedagogue
to the boys who have the affliction of possessing him as headmaster.
It is impossible to read some of these whipping sermons,
without a feeling of intense disgust. Flagellation is there hinted
at, mentioned, menaced, caressed as it were, as if in the very idea
there was a sort of delight. The worst passage of all is where the
amiable master tells his youthful hearers that they are noble by
birth, that the greatest humiliation to a noble person is the infliction
of a blow, and that nevertheless, he, the absolute master, may
have to flog many of them. How the young people over whom
he rules, must love such an instructor! The circumstance reminds
me of the late Mr. Ducrow, who was once teaching a boy to go
through a difficult act of horsemanship, in the character of a page.
The boy was timid, and his great master applied the whip to him
unmercifully. Mr. Joseph Grimaldi was standing by, and looked
very serious, considering his vocation. “You see,” remarked
Ducrow to Joey, “that it is quite necessary to <i>make an impression</i>
on these young fellows.”—“Very likely,” answered Grimaldi,
dryly, “but it can hardly be necessary to make <i>the whacks</i> so
hard!”</p>

<p>The discipline to which pages were subjected in the houses of
knights and noblemen, does not appear to have been at all of a
severe character. Beyond listening to precept from the chaplain,
heeding the behests of their master, and performing pleasant duties
about their mistress, they seem to have been left pretty much to
themselves, and to have had, altogether, a pleasant time of it. The
poor scholars had by far a harder life than your “Sir page.” And
this stern discipline held over the pale student continued down to
a very recent, that is, a comparatively recent period. In Neville’s
play of “The Poor Scholar,” written in 1662, but never acted, the
character of student-life at college is well illustrated. The scene
lies at the university, where Eugenes, jun., albeit he is called “the
poor scholar,” is nephew of Eugenes, sen., who is president of a
college. Nephew and uncle are at feud, and the man in authority
imprisons his young kinsman, who contrives to escape from durance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
vile, and to marry a maiden called Morphe. The fun of
the marriage is, that the young couple disguise themselves as country
lad and lass, and the reverend Eugenes, sen., unconsciously
couples a pair whom he would fain have kept apart. There are
two other university marriages as waggishly contrived; and when
the ceremonies are concluded, one of the newly-married students,
bold as any page, impudently remarks to the duped president,
“Our names are out of the butteries, and our persons out of your
dominions.” The phrase shows that, in the olden time, an “ingenuus
puer” at Oxford, if he were desirous of escaping censure,
had only to take his name off the books. But there were worse
penalties than mere censure. The author of “The Poor Scholar”
makes frequent allusion to the whipping of undergraduates,
stretched on a barrel, in the buttery. There was long an accredited
tradition that Milton had been thus degraded. In Neville’s
play, one of the young Benedicks, prematurely married, remarks,
“Had I been once in the butteries, they’d have their rods about
me.” To this remark Eugenes, jun., adds another in reference to
his uncle the president, “He would have made thee ride on a barrel,
and made you show your fat cheeks.” But it is clear that
even this terrible penalty could be avoided by young gentlemen,
if they had their wits about them; for the fearless Aphobos makes
boast, “My name is cut out of the college butteries, and I have
now no title to the mounting a barrel.”</p>

<p>Young scions of noble houses, in the present time, have to endure
more harsh discipline than is commonly imagined. They
are treated rather like the buttery undergraduates of former days,
than the pages who, in ancient castles, learned the use of arms,
served the Chatellaine, and invariably fell in love with the daughters.
They who doubt this fact have only to read those Whipping
Sermons to which I have referred. Such discourses, in days of
old, to a body of young pages, would probably have cost the
preacher more than he cared to lose. In these days, such sermons
can hardly have won affection for their author. The latter, no
doubt, honestly thought he was in possession of a vigorously salubrious
principle; but there is something ignoble both in the discipline
boasted of, and especially in the laying down the irresistible
fact to young gentlemen that a blow was the worst offence that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
could be inflicted on persons of their class, but that <i>he</i> could and
would commit such assault upon them, and that gentle and noble
as they were, they dared not resent it!</p>

<p>The pages of old time occasionally met with dreadful harsh
treatment from their chivalrous master. The most chivalrous of
these Christian knights could often act cowardly and unchristian-like.
I may cite, as an instance, the case of the great and warlike
Duke of Burgundy, on his defeat at Muret. He was hemmed in
between ferocious enemies and the deep lake. As the lesser of
two evils, he plunged into the latter, and his young page leaped
upon the crupper as the Duke’s horse took the water. The stout
steed bore his double burden across, a breadth of two miles, not
without difficulty, yet safely. The Duke was, perhaps, too alarmed
himself, at first, to know that the page was hanging on behind;
but when the panting horse reached the opposite shore, sovereign
Burgundy was so wroth at the idea that the boy, by clinging to
his steed, had put the life of the Duke in peril, that he turned
upon him and poignarded the poor lad upon the beach. Lassels,
who tells the story, very aptly concludes it with the scornful yet
serious ejaculation, “Poor Prince! thou mightest have given another
offering of thanksgiving to God for thy escape, than this!”
But “Burgundy” was rarely gracious or humane. “Carolus
Pugnax,” says Burton, in his Anatomy of Melancholy, “made
Henry Holland, late Duke of Exeter, exiled, run after his horse,
like a lackey, and would take no notice of him.” This was the
English peer who was reduced to beg his way in the cities of
Flanders.</p>

<p>Of pages generally, we shall have yet to speak incidentally—meanwhile,
let us glance at their masters at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">Ritter Eric</span>, of Lansfeldt, remarked, that next to a battle he
dearly loved a banquet. We will, therefore, commence the
“Knight at Home,” by showing him at table. Therewith, we
may observe, that the Knights of the Round Table appear generally
to have had very solid fare before them. King Arthur—who
is the reputed founder of this society, and who invented the
table in order that when all his knights were seated none could
claim precedency over the others—is traditionally declared to
have been the first man who ever sat down to a whole roasted ox.
Mr. Bickerstaff, in the “Tatler,” says that “this was certainly the
best way to preserve the gravy;” and it is further added, that “he
and his knights set about the ox at his round table, and usually
consumed it to the very bones before they would enter upon any
debate of moment.”</p>

<p>They had better fare than the knights-errant, who</p>

<p>The lords and chivalric gentlemen who fared so well and fought
so stoutly, were not always of the gentlest humor at home. It has
been observed that Piedmontese society long bore traces of the
chivalric age. An exemplification is afforded us in Gallenga’s
History of Piedmont. It will serve to show how absolute a master
a powerful knight and noble was in his own house. Thus, from
Gallenga we learn that Antonio Grimaldi, a nobleman of Chieri,
had become convinced of the faithlessness of his wife. He compelled
her to hang up with her own hand her paramour to the
ceiling of her chamber; then he had the chamber walled up, doors
and windows, and only allowed the wretched woman as much air
and light, and administered with his own hand as much food and
drink, as would indefinitely prolong her agony. And so he watched
her, and tended her with all that solicitude which hatred can suggest
as well as love, and left her to grope alone in that blind solitude,
with the mute testimony of her guilt—a ghastly object on
which her aching eyes were riveted, day by day, night after night,
till it had passed through every loathsome stage of decomposition.
This man was surely worse in his vengeance than that Sir Giles
de Laval, who has come down to us under the name of Blue-Beard.</p>

<p>This celebrated personage, famous by his pseudonym, was not
less so in his own proper person. There was not a braver knight
in France, during the reigns of Charles VI. and VII., than this
Marquis de Laval, Marshal of France. The English feared him
almost as much as they did the Pucelle. The household of this
brave gentleman was, however, a hell upon earth; and licentiousness,
blasphemy, attempts at sorcery, and, more than attempts at,
very successful realizations of, murder were the little foibles of
this man of many wives. He excelled the most extravagant monarchs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
in his boundless profusion, and in the barbaric splendor of
his court or house: the latter was thronged with ladies of very
light manners, players, mountebanks, pretended magicians, and as
many cooks as Julian found in the palace of his predecessor at
Constantinople. There were two hundred saddle-horses in his
stable, and he had a greater variety of dogs than could now be
found at any score of “fanciers” of that article. He employed the
magicians for a double purpose. They undertook to discover
treasures for his use, and pretty handmaids to tend on his illustrious
person, or otherwise amuse him by the display of their accomplishments.
Common report said that these young persons were
slain after a while, their blood being of much profit in making incantations,
the object of which was the discovery of gold. Much
exaggeration magnified his misdeeds, which were atrocious enough
in their plain, unvarnished infamy. At length justice overtook
this monster. She did not lay hold of him for his crimes against
society, but for a peccadillo which offended the Duke of Brittany.
Giles de Laval, for this offence, was burnt at Nantes, after being
strangled—such mercy having been vouchsafed to him, because
he was a gallant knight and gentleman, and of course was not to
be burnt alive like any petty villain of peasant degree. He had
a moment of weakness at last, and just previous to the rope being
tightened round his neck, he publicly declared that he should never
have come to that pass, nor have committed so many excesses,
had it not been for his wretched education. Thus are men, shrewd
enough to drive bargains, and able to discern between virtue and
vice, ever ready, when retribution falls on them at the scaffold, to
accuse their father, mother, schoolmaster, or spiritual pastor. Few
are like the knight of the road, who, previous to the cart sliding
from under him, at Tyburn, remarked that he had the satisfaction,
at least, of knowing that the position he had attained in society
was owing entirely to himself. “May I be hanged,” said he, “if
that isn’t the fact.” The finisher of the law did not stop to argue
the question with him, but, on cutting him down, remarked, with
the gravity of a cardinal before breakfast, that the gentleman had
wronged the devil and the ladies, in attributing his greatness so
exclusively to his own exertions.</p>

<p>I have said that perhaps Blue-Beard’s little foibles have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
exaggerated; but, on reflection, I am not sure that this pleasant
hypothesis can be sustained. De Laval, of whom more than I
have told may be found in Mezeray, was not worse than the Landvogt
Hugenbach, who makes so terrible a figure in Barante’s
“Dukes of Burgundy.” The Landvogt, we are told by the last-named
historian, cared no more for heaven than he did for anybody
on earth. He was accustomed to say that being perfectly
sure of going to the devil, he would take especial care to deny
himself no gratification that he could possibly desire. There was,
accordingly, no sort of wild fancy to which he did not surrender
himself. He was a fiendish corruptor of virtue, employing money,
menaces, or brutal violence, to accomplish his ends. Neither cottage
nor convent, citizen’s hearth nor noble’s château, was secure
from his invasion and atrocity. He was terribly hated, terribly
feared—but then Sir Landvogt Hugenbach gave splendid dinners,
and every family round went to them, while they detested the
giver.</p>

<p>He was remarkably facetious on these occasions, sometimes
ferociously so. For instance, Barante records of him, that at one
of his pleasant soirées he sent away the husbands into a room
apart, and kept the wives together in his grand saloon. These,
he and his myrmidons despoiled entirely of their dresses; after
which, having flung a covering over the head of each lady, who
dared not, for her life, resist, the amiable host called in the husbands
one by one, and bade each select his own wife. If the husband
made a mistake, he was immediately seized and flung headlong
down the staircase. The Landvogt made no more scruple
about it than Lord Ernest Vane when he served the Windsor
manager after something of the same fashion. The husbands who
guessed rightly were conducted to the sideboard to receive congratulations,
and drink various flasks of wine thereupon. But the
amount of wine forced upon each unhappy wretch was so immense,
that in a short time he was as near death as the mangled husbands,
who were lying in a senseless heap at the foot of the staircase.</p>

<p>They who would like to learn further of this respectable individual,
are referred to the pages of Barante. They will find there
that this knight and servant of the Duke of Burgundy was more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
like an incarnation of the devil than aught besides. His career
was frightful for its stupendous cruelty and crime; but it ended
on the scaffold, nevertheless. His behavior there was like that
of a saint who felt a little of the human infirmity of irritability at
being treated as a very wicked personage by the extremely blind
justice of men. So edifying was this chivalrous scoundrel, that
the populace fairly took him for the saint he figured to be; and
long after his death, crowds flocked to his tomb to pray for his
mediation between them and God.</p>

<p>The rough jokes of the Landvogt remind me of a much greater
man than he—Gaston de Foix, in whose earlier times there was
no lack of rough jokes, too. The portrait of Gaston, with his
page helping to buckle on his armor, by Giorgione da Castel
Franco, is doubtless known to most of my readers—through the
engraving, if not the original. It was formerly the property of
the Duke of Orleans; but came, many years ago, into the possession,
by purchase, of Lord Carlisle. The expression of the page
or young squire who is helping to adjust Gaston’s armor is admirably
rendered. That of the hero gives, perhaps, too old a look
to a knight who is known to have died young.</p>

<p>This Gaston was a nephew of Louis XII. His titles were
Duke of Nemours and Count d’Etampes. He was educated by
his mother, the sister of King Louis. She exulted in Gaston as
one who was peculiarly her own work. “Considering,” she says,
“how honor became her son, she was pleased to let him seek danger
where he was likely to find fame.” His career was splendid,
but proportionally brief. He purchased imperishable renown, and
a glorious death, in Italy. He gained the victory of Ravenna,
at the cost of his life; after which event, fortune abandoned the
standard of Louis; and Maximilian Sforza recovered the Milanese
territories of his father, Ludovic. This was early in the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>But it is of another Gaston de Foix that I have to speak. I
have given precedence to one bearer of the name, because he was
the worthier man; but the earlier hero will afford us better illustrations
of the home-life of the noble knights who were sovereigns
within their own districts. Froissart makes honorable mention of
him in his “Chronicle.” He was Count de Foix, and kept court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
at Ortez, in the south of France. There assembled belted knights
and aspiring ’squires, majestic matrons and dainty damsels.
When the Count was not on a war-path, his house was a scene of
great gayety. The jingle of spurs, clash of swords, tramp of iron
heels, virelays sung by men-at-arms, love-songs hummed by audacious
pages, and romances entoned to the lyre by minstrels who
were masters in the art—these, with courtly feasts and stately
dances, made of the castle at Ortez anything but a dull residence.
Hawking and hunting seem to have been “my very good Erle’s”
favorite diversion. He was not so much master of his passions as
he was of his retainers; and few people thought the worse of him
simply because he murdered his cousin for refusing to betray
his trust, and cut the throat of the only legitimate son of the
Earl.</p>

<p>We may form some idea of the practical jests of those days,
from an anecdote told by Froissart. Gaston de Foix had complained,
one cold day, of the scanty fire which his retainers kept
up in the great gallery. Whereupon one of the knights descended
to the court-yard, where stood several asses laden with wood. One
of them he seized, wood and ass together, and staggering up-stairs
into the gallery, flung the whole, the ass heels uppermost, on to
the fire. “Whereof,” says Froissart, “the Earl of Foix had great
joy, and so had all they that were there, and had marvel of his
strength, how he alone came up all the stairs with the ass and the
wood on his neck.”</p>

<p>Gaston was but a lazy knight. It was high noon, Froissart
tells us, before he rose from his bed. He supped at midnight;
and when he issued from his chamber to proceed to the hall where
supper was laid, twelve torches were carried before him, and
these were held at his table “by twelve varlets” during the time
that supper lasted. The Earl sat alone, and none of the knights
or squires who crowded round the other tables dared to speak a
word to him unless the great man previously addressed him. The
supper then must have been a dull affair.</p>

<p>The treasurer of the Collegiate Church of Chimay relates in a
very delicate manner how Gaston came to murder his little son.
Gaston’s wife was living apart from her husband, at the court of
her brother, the King of Navarre, and the “little son” in question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
was residing there on a visit to his mother. As he was on the
point of returning, the king of Navarre gave him a powder, which
he directed the boy to administer to his father, telling him that it
was a love-powder, and would bring back his father’s affection for
the mother. The innocent boy took the powder, which was in
fact poison; and a night or two after his return to Ortez, an illegitimate
son of Gaston found it in the boy’s clothes. The base-born
lad informed against his brother, and when Gaston had given
the powder to a dog, which immediately died, he could scarcely be
kept from poniarding his son upon the spot. The poor child
was flung into a dungeon, where, between terror and despair, he
refused to take any food. Upon being told of this, the earl entered
the chamber in which the boy was confined, “he had at the
same time a little knife in his hand, to pare withal his nails....
In great displeasure he thrust his hand at his son’s throat, and the
point of his knife a little entered into his throat into a certain vein;
and the earl said, ‘Ah, traitor, why dost thou not eat thy meat?’
and therewith the earl departed without any more doing or saying.”
Never was brutal murder more daintily glozed over, but Froissart
is so afraid that he may not have sufficiently impressed you with
a conviction of its being a little accident, that he goes on to say
“The child was abashed, and afraid of the coming of his father,
and was also feeble of fasting, and the point of the knife a little
entered into his throat, into a certain vein of his throat; and so
[he] fell down suddenly <i>and died</i>!”</p>

<p>The rascally sire was as jolly after the deed as before it; but
he too one day “fell down suddenly and died.” He had overheated
himself with hunting, and in that condition bathed in cold
water as soon as he reached home. The description of the whole
of this domestic scene is one of the most graphic in Froissart, but
it is too long for quotation. It must suffice that the vast possessions
of the count fell into the hands of that villanous illegitimate
son, Sir Jenbayne de Foix. The latter was one of the six knights
who, with Charles VI., entered a ball-room disguised as satyrs,
and fast chained together. Some one, who is supposed to have
owed no good-will to the king, flung a torch into the group. Their
inflammable dresses immediately caught fire, and Sir Jenbayne de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
Foix was one of those who was burned to death. The king himself,
as is well known, had a very narrow escape.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the chief home pleasures enjoyed by knights
when not engaged in war, was the pleasure of the chase. Idle
country gentlemen now resemble their chivalrous ancestors in this
respect, and for want of or distaste for other vocations, spend three
fourths of their rural time in the fields. In the old days too, as
ever, there were clerical gentlemen very much addicted to hunting
and moreover not less so to trespassing. These were not reverend
rectors on their own thorough-breds, or curates on borrowed
ponies, but dignified prelates—even archbishops. One of the
latter, Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury, in the beginning of the
thirteenth century, presumed to hunt without permission, on the
grounds of a young knight, the Earl of Arundel, a minor. On
the day the Earl came of age, he issued a prohibition against the
archiepiscopal trespasser, and the latter in return snapped his
fingers at the earl, and declared that his way was as legally open
to any chase as it was free into any church. Accordingly, the
right reverend gentleman issued forth as usual, with hounds and
horses, and a “numerous meet” of clerical friends and other followers,
glad to hunt in such company. Their sport, however, was
spoiled by the retainers of the young earl. These, in obedience
to their master’s orders, called off the dogs, unstopped the earths,
warned off the riders, and laughed at the ecclesiastical thunder of
the prelate, flung at them in open field. Edmund, finding it impossible
to overcome the opposition of the men, addressed himself
to the master, summarily devoting him <i>ad inferos</i> for daring to
interfere with the prelatic pastimes. Nothing daunted, the young
earl, who would gladly have permitted the archbishop to hunt in
his company, whenever so disposed, but who would not allow the
head of the church in England to act in the woods of Arundel as
if he were also lord of the land, made appeal to the only competent
court—that of the Pope. The contending parties went
over and pleaded their most respective causes personally; the
earl with calmness, as feeling that he had right on his side; Edmund
with easy arrogance, springing from a conviction that the
Pontiff would not give a layman a triumph over a priest. The
archbishop, however, was mistaken. He not only lost his cause,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
but he was condemned in the expenses; and if any one thinks
that this decree checked him in trespassing, such an idea would
show that the holder of it knew little of the spirit which moved
prelates fond of hunting. The archbishop became the most confirmed
poacher in the country; and if he did not spoil the knight’s
sport by riding in advance of the hounds with a red herring, he
had resort to means as efficacious for marring the pleasures of
others in the chase. He affected, too, to look down upon the earl
as one inferior to him in degree, and when they encountered at
court, the prelate exhibited no more courtesy toward the gallant
knight than was manifested by Lord Cowley in Paris toward the
English Exhibition Commissioners, when the mere men of intellect
were kept at what the peer thought a proper distance by the mere
men of rank.</p>

<p>There is, however, no lack of instances of young knights themselves
being brought up in arrogance and wilfulness. This sort
of education lasted longer, perhaps, in France than elsewhere.
As late as the last century this instruction prevailed, particularly
where the pupil was intended for the army. Thus, the rearing
of the little Vidame d’Amiens affords us an illustration. He was
awkward and obstinate, but he might have been cured of both
defects, had his mother been permitted to have some voice in his
education. She was the last to be consulted, or rather, was never
consulted at all. The more the little man was arrogant, the more
delighted were his relatives with such manifestation of his spirit;
and one day, when he dealt to his aunt, the Marquise de Belliere
Plessis, a box of the ear which sent the old lady staggering, her
only remark was, “My dear, you should never strike me with the
left hand.” The courteous Vidame mortally hated his tutor, and
expressed such a desire to kill him, that the pedagogue was asked
to allow the little savage to believe that he had accomplished the
desired act of homicide. Accordingly, a light musket was placed
in the boy’s hands, from which the ball had been drawn, unknown
to him, and with this, coming suddenly upon his instructor, who
feigned the surprise he did not feel, the Vidame discharged the
piece full at the breast of his monitor and friend. The servile
sage pretended to be mortally wounded, and acted death upon the
polished floor. He was quietly got rid of, and a pension of four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
hundred francs, just sixteen pounds a year, rewarded his stupid
servility. The little chevalier was as proud as Fighting Fitzgerald
of having, as he supposed, “killed his man.”</p>

<p>Let us return to earlier times for illustrations of the knight at
home, and also abroad. There is no lack of such illustration in
the adventures of Fulke Fitzwarren. Fulke was one of the
outlawed barons of the reign of King John. In his youth, he
was brought up with the four sons of King Henry; he was much
beloved by them all, except John. “It happened that John and
Fulke were sitting all alone in a chamber playing at chess; and
John took the chess-board, and struck Fulke with a great blow.
Fulke felt himself hurt, raised his foot and struck John in the
middle of the stomach; and his head flew against the wall, and he
became all weak, and fainted. Fulke was in consternation; but
he was glad that there was nobody in the chamber but they two,
and he rubbed John’s ears, who recovered from his fainting fit,
and went to the king his father, and made a great complaint.
‘Hold your tongue, wretch,’ said the king, ‘you are always quarrelling.
If Fulke did anything but good to you, it must have
been by your own desert;’ and he called his master, and made him
beat him finely and well for complaining. John was much enraged
against Fulke, so that he could never afterward love him heartily.”</p>

<p>The above, as has been remarked, evinces how little respect
there was in those early times for royal authority and the doctrine
of non-resistance. But it may be observed, that even in these
more polite times, were the heir-apparent to strike a playfellow,
his royal highness would probably meet in return with as ready-handed,
if not quite so rough a correction as was inflicted upon
John. The latter could not forgive a bold companion of his boyhood,
as James I. did, in subsequent times, with regard to “Jamie
Slates.” On the contrary, when John became king, he plotted
with as unscrupulous a person as himself, to deprive Fulke of his
estate. The conversation between the king and his confederate,
Moris de Powis, was overheard; and what came of it is thus told
in the history of Fulke Fitzwarren, as edited by Thomas Wright
Esq., for the Warton Club:—</p>

<p>“There was close by a knight who had heard all the conversation
between the king and Moris, and he went in haste to Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
Fulke, and told him that the king was about to confirm by his
charter, to Sir Moris, the lands to which he had right. Fulke
and his four brothers came before the king, and prayed that they
might have the common law and the lands to which they had claim
and right, as the inheritance of Fulke; and they prayed that the
king would receive from them a hundred pounds, on condition that
he should grant them the award of his court of gain and loss.
The king told them that what he had granted to Sir Moris, he
would hold to it whoever might be offended or who not. At length
Sir Moris spoke to Sir Fulke, and said, ‘Sir Knight, you are a
great fool to challenge my lands; if you say that you have a right
to White-Town, you lie; and if we were not in the king’s presence
I would have proved it on your body.’ Sir William, Fulke’s
brother, without a word more, sprang forward and struck Sir Moris
with his fist in the middle of his face, that it became all bloody;
knights interfered that no more hurt was done; then said Sir
Fulke to the king: ‘Sir King, you are my liege-lord, and to you
was I bound by fealty, as long as I was in your service, and as
long as I held the lands of you; and you ought to maintain me in
right, and you fail me in right and common law; and never was
he good king who denied his frank tenants law in his court; wherefore
I return you your homages:’ and with this word, he departed
from the court and went to his hostel.”</p>

<p>Fulke was most unjustly exiled, but after a while he returned
to England, wandered about in various disguises, and at length,
with a ripe project, settled down as a collier or charcoal-burner in
Windsor Forest. I will once more draw from Mr. Wright’s edition
of this knightly biography for what ensued.</p>

<p>“At length came the king with three knights, all on foot to
Fulke, where he was arranging his fire. When Fulke saw the
king, he knew him well enough, and he cast the fork from his
hand and saluted his lord and went on his knees before him very
humbly. The king and his three knights had great laughter and
game at the breeding and bearing of the collier. They stood there
very long. ‘Sir Vilain,’ said the king, ‘have you seen no stag or
doe pass here?’ ‘Yes, my lord, awhile ago.’ ‘What beast did
you see?’ ‘Sir, my lord, a horned one; and it had long horns.’
‘Where is it?’ ‘Sir, my lord, I know very well how to lead you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
to where I saw it.’ ‘Onward then, Sir Vilain, and we will follow
you.’ ‘Sir,’ said the collier, ‘shall I take my fork in my hand?
for if it were taken I should have thereby a great loss.’ ‘Yea,
Vilain, if you will.’ Fulke took the great fork of iron in his hand
and led the king to shoot; for he had a very handsome bow.
‘Sir, my lord,’ said Fulke, ‘will you please to wait, and I will go
into the thicket and make the beast come this way by here?’
‘Yea,’ said the king. Fulke did hastily spring into the thick of
the forest; and commanded his company hastily to seize upon
King John, for ‘I have brought him there only with three knights;
and all his company is on the other side of the forest.’ Fulke and
his company leaped out of the thicket, and rushed upon the king
and seized him at once. ‘Sir King,’ said Fulke, ‘now I have you
in my power, such judgment I will execute on you as you would
on me, if you had taken me.’ The king trembled with fear for
he had great dread of Fulke.”</p>

<p>There is here, perhaps, something of the romantic history, but
with a substantiality of truth. In the end, Fulke, who we are
told was really one of the barons to whom we owe Magna Charta,
and who was anathematized by the pope, and driven into exile
again and again, got the better of all his enemies, pope and king
included. There are two traditions touching his death. One is,
that he survived to the period of the battle of Lewes, where he
was one of a body of Henry the Third’s friends who were drowned
in the adjacent river. The other tells a very different story, and
is probably nearer the truth. We are inclined to think with Mr.
Wright, the editor of the biographical history in question, that he
who was drowned near Lewes, was the son of Fulke. We add
the following account, less because of its detail touching the death
of the old knight than as having reference to how knights lived,
moved, and had their being, in the period referred to:—</p>

<p>“Fulke and Lady Clarice his wife, one night, were sleeping
together in their chamber; and the lady was asleep, and Fulke
was awake, and thought of his youth; and repented much in his
heart for his trespasses. At length, he saw in the chamber so
great a light, that it was wonderful; and he thought what could it
be? And he heard a voice, as it were, of thunder in the air, and
it said:—‘Vassal, God has granted thy penance, which is better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
here than elsewhere.’ At that word the lady awoke, and saw the
great light, and covered her face for fear. At length this light
vanished. And after this light Fulke could never see more, but
he was blind all his days. Then Fulke was very hospitable and
liberal, and he caused the king’s road to be turned through his hall
at his manor of Alleston, in order no stranger might pass without
having meat or lodging, or other honor or goods of his. This
Fulke remained seven years blind, and suffered well his penance.
Lady Clarice died and was buried at the New Abbey; after whose
death Fulke lived but a year, and died at the White-town; and
in great honor was he interred at the New Abbey—on whose
soul may God have mercy. Near the altar is the body. God
have mercy on us all, alive and dead. Amen!”</p>

<p>The religious sentiment was strong in all Norman knights, but
not more so, perhaps, than in the wild chivalry of North America,
when first its painted heroes heard of the passion and death of
Christ. Charlevoix tells us of an Iroquois, who, on hearing of the
crucifixion, exclaimed with the feeling of a Christian crusader,
“Oh, if I had been there!” Precisely such an exclamation was
once made by a Norman knight, as he listened to a monk narrating
the great sacrifice on Mount Calvary. The more savage
warrior, however, has always had the more poetical feeling. Witness
the dying request of a young Indian chief, also noticed by
Charlevoix. The dying victor asked to be buried in a blue robe,
because that was the color of the sky: the fashion, with many
Norman knights, of being interred in a robe and cowl of a monk,
had far less of elevated feeling for its motive.</p>

<p>Having shown something of what the knight did at home, let us
contemplate also what he taught there, by precept, if not by example.
There was a knight who was known by the title of “the
White Knight,” whose name was De la Tour Landay, who was a
contemporary of Edward the Black Prince, and who is supposed
to have fought at Poictiers. He, is, however, best known, or at
least equally well known, as the author of a work entitled “Le
Livre du Chevalier de la Tour Landay.” This book was written,
or dictated by him, for the especial benefit of his two daughters,
and for the guidance of young ladies generally. It is extremely indelicate
in parts, and in such wise gives no very favorable idea of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
young ladies who could bear such instruction as is here imparted.
The Chevalier performed his authorship after a very free and easy
fashion. He engaged four clerical gentlemen, strictly designated
as “two priests and two clerks,” whose task it was to procure for
him all the necessary illustrative materials, such as anecdotes,
apophthegms, and such like. These were collected from all
sources, sacred and profane—from the Bible down to any volume,
legendary or historical, that would suit his purpose. These he
worked mosaically together, adding such wise saw, moral, counsel,
or sentiment, as he deemed the case most especially required;—with
a sprinkling of stories of his own collecting. A critic in the
“Athenæum,” commenting upon this curious volume, says with
great truth, that it affords good materials for an examination into
the morals and manners of the times. “Nothing,” says the reviewer,
“is urged for adoption upon the sensible grounds of right
or wrong, or as being in accordance with any admitted moral
standard, but because it has been sanctified by long usage, been
confirmed by pretended miracle, or been approved by some superstition
which outrages common sense.”</p>

<p>In illustration of these remarks it is shown how the Chevalier
recommends a strict observation of the meagre days, upon the
ground that the dissevered head of a soldier was once enabled to
call for a priest, confess, and listen to the absolution, because the
owner of the head had never transgressed the Wednesday and
Friday’s fasts throughout his lifetime. Avoidance of the seven
capital sins is enjoined upon much the same grounds. Gluttony,
for instance, is to be avoided, for the good reason, that a prattling
magpie once betrayed a lady who had eaten a dish of eels, which
her lord had intended for some guests whom he wished particularly
to honor. Charity is enjoined, not because the practice thereof is
placed by the great teacher, not merely above Hope, but before
Faith, but because a lady who, in spite of priestly warning, gave
the broken victuals of her household to her dogs rather than to
the poor, being on her death-bed, was leaped upon by a couple of
black dogs, and that these having approached her lips, the latter
became as black as a coal. The knight the more insists upon
the proper exercise of charity, seeing that he has unquestionable
authority in support of the truth of the story. That is, he knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
a lady that had known the defunct, and who said she had seen the
dogs. Implicit obedience of wives to husbands is insisted on, with
a forcibly illustrative argument. A burgher’s wife had answered
her lord sharply, in place of silently listening to reproof, and
meekly obeying his command. The husband, thereupon, dealt his
wife a blow with his clenched fist, which smashed her nose, and
felled her to the ground. “It is reason and right,” says the mailed
Mrs. Ellis of his time, “that the husband should have the word of
command, and it is an honor to the good wife to hear him, and
hold her peace, and leave all high talking to her lord; and so, on
the contrary, it is a great shame to hear a woman strive with her
husband, <i>whether right or wrong</i>, and especially before other people.”
Publius Syrus says, that a good wife commands by obeying,
but the Chevalier evidently had no idea of illustrating the
Latin maxim, or recommending the end which it contemplates.
The knight places the husband as absolute lord; and his doing so,
in conjunction with the servility which he demands on the part of
the wife, reminds me of the saying of Toulotte, which is as true as
anything enjoined by the moralizing knight, namely, that “<i>L’obéissance
aux volontés d’un chef absolu assimile l’homme à la brute</i>.”
This, with a verbal alteration, may be applied as expressive of
the effect of the knight’s teaching in the matter of feminine obedience.
The latter is indeed in consonance with the old heathen
ideas. Euripides asserts, that the most intolerable wife in the
world is a wife who philosophizes, or supports her own opinion.
We are astonished to find a Christian knight thus agreed with a
heathen poet—particularly as it was in Christian times that the
maxim was first published, which says, “<i>Ce que femme veut, Dieu
le veut!</i>”</p>

<p>This sentiment reminds me, that it is time to show how the
knight was affected by the tender passion, how it was sometimes
his glory and sometimes his shame. He was sometimes the victim,
and at others the victimizer.</p>

<p>However willing a knight may have been to do homage to his
lady, the latter, if she truly regarded the knight, never allowed his
homage to her to be paid at the cost of injury to his country’s honor
or his own. An instance of this is afforded us in the case of Bertrand
de Guesclin. There never was man who struck harder
blows when he was a bachelor; but when he went a wooing, and
still more after he had wed the incomparable Tiphania, he lost all
care for honor in the field, and had no delight but in the society
of his spouse. The lady, however, was resolved that neither his
sword nor his reputation should acquire rust through any fault or
beauty of hers. She rallied him soundly on his home-keeping
propensities, set them in contrast with the activity of his bachelor-days,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
and the renown acquired by it, and forthwith talked him out
of her bower and into his saddle.</p>

<p>The English did not profit by the lady’s eloquence, for our forefathers
never had a more gallant or more difficult adversary to
deal with than Bertrand. Living, his name was a terror to them;
and dying, he had the sympathy of those who had been his foes.
Charles V. made him Constable of France, and appointed him a
grave at the foot of his own royal tomb. De Guesclin would never
have been half the man he was but for the good sense of his wife
Tiphania.</p>

<p>There are many instances in romance which would seem to imply,
that so strained was the sentiment which bound knights to respect
ladies, it compelled them not to depart therefrom even in
extreme cases, involving lightness of conduct and infidelity. The
great northern chiefs, who were a sort of very rough knights in
their way, were, however, completely under the distaff. Their
wives could divorce themselves at will. Thus, in Erysbiggia Saga
we read of Borck, an Icelandic chief, who, bringing home a guest
whom his wife not only refused to welcome, but attempted to stab,
administered such correction to his spouse in return, that the lady
called in witnesses and divorced herself on the spot. Thereupon
the household goods were divided among them, and the affair was
rapidly and cheaply managed without the intervention of an Ecclesiastical
Court. More modern chivalry would not have tolerated
the idea of correcting even a faithless, much less a merely angry
spouse. Indeed, the amatory principle was quite as strong as the
religious one; and in illustration thereof, it has been remarked
that the knight must have been more than ordinarily devout who
had God on his <i>right</i> hand (the place of honor), and his lady on
his <i>left</i>.</p>

<p>To <i>ride at the ring</i> was then the pleasantest pastime for knights;
and ladies looked on and applauded the success, or laughed at the
failures. The riding, without attempting to carry off the ring, is
still common enough at our fairs, for children; but in France and
Germany, it is seriously practised in both its simple and double
forms, by persons of all ages, who glide round to the grinding of
an organ, and look as grave as if they were on desperate business.</p>

<p>It is an undoubted matter of fact, that although a knight was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
bound to be tender in his gallantry, there were some to be found
whose wooing was of the very roughest; and there were others
who, if not rough, were rascally.</p>

<p>The old Rue des Lombards, in Paris, was at one time occupied
exclusively by the “professed pourpoint-makers,” as a modern
tailor might say. They carried on a flourishing trade, especially
in times when men, like Bassompierre, thought nothing of paying,
or promising to pay, fourteen thousand crowns for a pourpoint.
When I say the street was thus occupied exclusively, I must notice
an exception. There were a few other residents in it, the
Jew money-lenders or usurers; and when I hear the old French
proverb cited “patient as a Lombard,” I do not know whether it
originally applied to the tailors or the money-lenders, both of whom
were extensively cheated by their knightly customers. Here is an
illustration of it, showing that all Jessicas have not been as lucky
as Shylock’s daughter, and that some Jews have been more cruelly
treated than Shylock’s daughter’s father—whom I have always
considered as one of the most ill-used of men.</p>

<p>In the Rue des Lombards there dwelt a wealthy Jew, who put
his money out at interest, and kept his daughter under lock and
key at home. But the paternal Jew did not close his shutters,
and the Lombard street Jessica, sitting all day at the window, attracted
the homage of many passers-by. These were chiefly
knights who came that way to be measured for pourpoints; and
no knight was more attracted by the black eyes of the young lady
in question, than the Chevalier Giles de Pontoise. That name
indeed is one of a celebrated hero of a burlesque tragedy, but the
original knight was “<i>my</i> Beverley.”</p>

<p>Giles wore the showiest pourpoint in the world; for which he
had obtained long credit. It struck him that he would call upon
the Jew to borrow a few hundred pistoles, and take the opportunity
to also borrow the daughter. He felt sure of succeeding in
both exploits; for, as he remarked, if he could not pay the money
he was about to borrow, he could borrow it of his more prudent
relatives, and so acquit himself of his debt. With regard to the
lady, he had serenaded her, night after night, till she looked as
ready to leap down to him as the Juliets who played to Barry’s
Romeo;—and he had sung “Ecco ridente il sole,” or what was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
then equivalent to it, accompanied by his guitar, and looking as
ridiculous the while, without being half so silvery-toned as Rubini
in Almaviva, warbling his delicious nonsense to Rosina. Our Jew,
like old Bartolo, was destined to pay the musician.</p>

<p>Giles succeeded in extracting the money required from the
usurer, and he had like success in inducing the daughter to trust
to his promises. He took the latter to Pontoise, deceived her by
a mock-marriage, and spent all that he had borrowed from the
father, in celebrating his pretended nuptials with the daughter.
There never was a more recreant knight than Giles de Pontoise.</p>

<p>However, bills will become due, if noble or simple put their
names to them, and the Jew claimed at once both his debt and his
daughter. He failed in obtaining his money, but the lady he carried
off by violence, she herself exhibiting considerable reluctance
to leave the Château de Pontoise for the paternal dungeon in the
Rue des Lombards.</p>

<p>This step brought Giles to a course of reflection. It was not
of that quality which his confessor would have recommended, but
rather of a satanic aspect. “In the usurer’s house,” thought Giles,
“live the tailor to whom I am indebted for my pourpoint, the Jew
who holds my promise to pay, and the pretty daughter of whom I
have been so unjustly deprived. I will set fire to the house. If
I burn tailor, money-lender, and the proofs of my liabilities, I shall
have done a good night’s work, if I therewith can carry off little
Jessica.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, Giles went down to the Rue des Lombards, and
with such aid as was then easily purchasable, he soon wrapped
the Jew’s dwelling in flames. Shylock looked to his papers and
money-bags. The knight groped through the smoke and carried
off the daughter. The Jew still held the promissory note of the
Knight of Pontoise, whose incendiary act, however, had destroyed
half of one side of the Rue des Lombards. Therewith had perished
reams of bonds which made slaves of chevaliers to Jew
money-lenders. “<i>Sic vos non vobis</i>,” thought Giles, “but at all
events, if he has my bill, I have possession of Jessica.”</p>

<p>The Jew held as much to his daughter as to his ducats. He
persecuted the pretended husband with a pertinacity which eventually
overcame Giles de Pontoise. A compromise was effected.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
The knight owed the usurer three thousand golden crowns, and
had stolen from him his only daughter. Giles agreed to surrender
his “lady,” on condition that the money-lender should sign an acquittance
of the debt. This done, the Jew and daughter walked
homeward, neither of them well satisfied with the result of their
dealings with a knight.</p>

<p>The burnt-out Lombarder turned round at the threshold of the
knight’s door, with a withering sneer, like Edmund Kean’s in
Shylock when he was told to make haste and go home, and begin
to be a Christian. “It is little but sorrow I get by you, at all
events,” said the Jew to the Chevalier.</p>

<p>“Do you make so light of your grandson?” asked Giles. And
with this Parthian dart he shut his door in the face of the trio
who were his victims.</p>

<p>This knight was a victimizer; but below we have an illustration
of knights victimized through too daring affection.</p>

<p>The great Karloman may be said to have been one of those
crowned knights who really had very little of the spirit of chivalry
in him, with respect to ladies. He married, successfully, two
wives, but to neither did he allow the title of Empress. It is,
however, not with his two wives, but his two daughters and their
chevaliers <i>par amours</i>, with whom we have now to do.</p>

<p>In the Rue de la Harpe, in Paris, may be seen the remains,
rather than the ruins, of the old building erected by the Emperor
Julian, and which was long known by the name of the “old palace.”
It served as a palace about a thousand years and half a
century ago, when one night there drew up before it a couple of
knights, admirably mounted, and rather roughly escorted by a
mob, who held up their lanterns to examine the riders, and handled
their pikes as if they were more ready to massacre the knights
than to marshal them.</p>

<p>All the civility they received on this February night was of a
highly equivocal nature. They were admitted, indeed, into the
first and largest court of the palace, but the old seneschal locked
and barred the gate behind them. An officer too approached to
bid them welcome, but he had hardly acquitted himself of his civil
mission when he peremptorily demanded of them the surrender of
their swords.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“We are the King’s own messengers,” said one of the knights,
rather puzzled at the reception vouchsafed to them;—“and we
have, moreover, a despatch to deliver, written in our gracious master’s
own hand,” remarked the second knight.</p>

<p>“Vive Louis le Debonnaire!” exclaimed the seneschal; “how
fares it with our sovereign?”</p>

<p>“As well as can be,” was the reply, “with a monarch who has
been engaged six whole weeks at Aix, in burying his father and
predecessor, Charlemagne. Here is his missive.” This missive
was from Louis the Frolicsome, or Louis the Good-Natured, or
Louis of Fair Aspect. He was morose, wittily disposed, and ill-featured;—but
then the poet-laureate had given him his fine
name; and the king wore it as if it had been fairly won. He had
clipped, shaved, and frocked, all his natural brothers, and then
shut them up in monasteries. He had no more respect for treaties
than he had for Mohammed, and by personal example he
taught perjury and rebellion to those whom he cruelly punished
when they imitated their exalted instructor. The seneschal perused
the letter addressed to him by his royal correspondent,
and immediately requested the two knights to enter the palace
itself.</p>

<p>They were ushered into a lofty-arched apartment on the ground
floor, which ordinarily served as an ante-room for the guards on
duty; it was for the moment, however, empty. They who have
visited the old Palais de Thermes, as it is called, have, doubtlessly,
remarked and admired this solid relic of the past.</p>

<p>After entering, the seneschal once more lifted the despatch to
the flambeau, read it through, looked at the seal, then at the
knights, coughed uneasily, and began to wear an air of dislike for
some duty imposed upon him. He repeated, as if he were learning
by rote, the names Raoul de Lys and Robert de Quercy.
“Those are our names,” observed the first; “we have ridden hither
by the king’s orders to announce his coming; and having done
so, let us have fire and food, lest we be famished and frozen before
he arrives.”</p>

<p>“Hem!” muttered the seneschal, “I am extremely sorry; but,
according to this letter, you are my prisoners, and till to-morrow
you must remain in this apartment;” and, seeing them about to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
remonstrate, he added, “You will be quite at liberty here, except,
of course, that you can’t get out; you will have separate quarters
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>It was in vain that they inquired the reason for their detention,
the nature of the charge alleged against them, or what they had
further to expect. The seneschal dryly referred them to the monarch.
He himself knew nothing more than his orders, and by
them he was instructed to keep the two friends in close confinement
till the sovereign’s arrival. “On second thoughts,” said the
seneschal, “I must separate you at once. There is the bell in the
tower of St. Jacques ringing midnight, and to-morrow will be upon
us, before its iron tongue has done wagging. I really must trouble
one of you gentlemen to follow me.” The voice was not so civil
as the words, and after much parleying and reluctance, the two
friends parted. Robert bade Raoul be of good cheer; and Raoul,
who was left behind, whispered that it would be hard, indeed, if
harm was to come to them under such a roof.</p>

<p>The roof, however, of this royal palace, looked very much like
the covering of a place in which very much harm might be very
quietly effected. But there were dwelling there two beings who
might have been taken for spirits of good, so winning, so natural,
and so loveable were the two spirits in question. They were no
other than the two daughters of Charlemagne, Gisla and Rotrude.
The romancers, who talk such an infinite deal of nonsense, say of
them that their sweet-scented beauty was protected by the prickles
of principle. The most rapid of analysers may see at once that
this was no great compliment to the ladies. It was meant, however,
to be the most refined flattery; and the will was accepted for
the deed.</p>

<p>Now, the two knights loved the two ladies, and if they had <i>not</i>,
neither Father Daniel nor Sainte Foix could have alluded to their
amorous history; nor Father Pasquale, of the Convent of the
Arminians in Venice, have touched it up with some of the hues
of romance, nor Roger de Beauvoir have woven the two together,
nor unworthy ægomet have applied it to the illustration of daring
lovers.</p>

<p>These two girls were marvellously high-spirited. They had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
been wooed by emperors; but feeling no inclination to answer
favorably to the wooing, Charlemagne generously refused to put
force upon their affections, and bade them love only where their
hearts directed them. This “license” gave courage to numberless
nobles of various degrees, but Rotrude and Gisla said nay to all
their regular advances. The Princesses were, in fact, something
like Miss Languish, thought love worth nothing without a little
excitement, and would have considered elopement as the proper
preceder of the nuptial ceremony. Their mother, Hildegarda,
was an unexceptional woman, but, like good Queen Charlotte, who
let her daughters read Polly Honeycombe as well as Hannah
More, she was a little confused in the way she taught morals, and
the young Princesses fell in love, at the first opportunity, with
gallant gentlemen of—as compared with princesses—rather low
degree. In this respect, there is a parallel between the house of
Karloman and some other houses of more modern times.</p>

<p>Louis le Debonnaire had, as disagreeable brothers will have,
an impertinent curiosity respecting his sisters’ affairs. He was,
here, the head of his family, and deemed himself as divinely empowered
to dispose of the hearts of these ladies, as of the families
and fortunes of his people. He had learned the love-passages
that had been going on, and he had hinted that when he reached
the old palace in Paris, he would make it as calmly cold as a
cloister, and that there were disturbed hearts there, which should
be speedily restored to a lasting tranquillity. The young ladies
did not trouble themselves to read the riddle of a brother who was
for ever affecting much mystery. But they prepared to welcome
his arrival, and seemed more than ordinarily delighted when they
knew that intelligence of his approaching coming had been brought
by the two knights then in the castle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Raoul de Lys sat shivering on a stone bench in the
great guard-room. He subsequently addressed himself to a scanty
portion of skinny wild boar, very ill-cooked; drank, with intense
disgust, part of a flask of hydromel of the very worst quality; and
then having gazed on the miniature of Rotrude, which he took
from beneath the buff jerkin under his corslet, he apostrophized it
till he grew sleepy, upon which he blew out his lamp, and threw
himself on an execrably hard couch. He was surprised to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
that he was not in the dark. There was very good reason for
the contrary.</p>

<p>As he blew out his lamp, a panel in the stone wall glided noiselessly
open, and Robert de Quercy appeared upon the threshold—one
hand holding a lamp, the other leading a lady. The lady was
veiled; and she and the knight hurriedly approached Raoul, who
as hurriedly rushed forward to meet them. He had laid his armor
by; and they who recollect Mr. Young in Hotspur, and how <i>he</i>
looked in tight buff suit, before he put his armor on, may have
some idea of the rather ridiculous guise in which Raoul appeared
to the lady. But she was used to such sights, and had not time
to remark it even had she not been so accustomed.</p>

<p>Raoul observing that Robert was accompanied only by Gisla,
made anxious inquiry for Rotrude. Gisla in a few words told
him that her sister would speedily be with them, that there was
certain danger, even death, threatening the two cavaliers, and
probable peril menacing—as Gisla remarked, with a blush—those
who loved them. The King, she added, had spoken angrily of
coming to purify the palace, as she had heard from Count Volrade,
who appears to have been a Polonius, as regards his office, with
all the gossip, but none of the good sense, of the old chamberlain
in Denmark.</p>

<p>“Death to us!” exclaimed Robert. “Accursed be the prince
who transgresses the Gospel admonition, not to forget his own or
his father’s friends.” “We were the favored servants of Charlemagne,”
said Raoul. “We were of his closest intimacy,” exclaimed
Robert. “Never,” interrupted Raoul, “did he ascend his
turret to watch the stars, without summoning us, his nocturnal
pages, as he called us, to his side.” “He dare not commit such a
crime; for the body of Charlemagne is scarcely sealed down in
its tomb; and Louis has not a month’s hold of the sceptre.”</p>

<p>“He holds it firmly enough, however, to punish villany,” exclaimed
Louis himself, as he appeared in the doorway leading to
a flight of stone stairs by which Gisla had indicated the speedy
appearance of Rotrude.</p>

<p>And here I would beseech my readers to believe that if the
word “tableau!” ought to be written at this situation, and if it appears
to them to be too melo-dramatic to be natural, <i>I</i> am not in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
fault. I refer them to all the histories and romances in which
this episode in knightly story is told, and in all they will find that
Louis makes his appearance exactly as I have described, and precisely
like Signor Tamburini in the great scene of Lucrezia Borgia.</p>

<p>Louis having given expression to his startling bit of recitative,
dragged forward Rotrude, whom he had held behind him, by the
wrist. The background was occupied by four guards, wearing
hoods; and I can not think of them without being reminded of
those same four old guards, with M. Desmousseaux at their head,
who always represented the Greek or Roman armies upon the
stage of the Théâtre Français, when Talma was the Nero or the
Sylla, the Orestes or the Capitolinus of the night.</p>

<p>With some allusion to Rotrude as a sacred dove, and to himself
as a bird-catcher, Louis handed his sister to a stone bench, and
then grew good-natured in his remarks. This sudden benevolence
gave a chill to the entire company. They turned as pale as any
Russian nobleman to whom Nicholas was extraordinarily civil.</p>

<p>“We know the winding passages of the palace of Thermes,”
said Louis, laughingly, “as well as our sisters; and I have not
gone through them to-night for the purpose of terrifying the sister
whom I encountered there, or the other sister whom I see here.
I am a kind-hearted brother, and am marvellously well-disposed.
I need only appeal to these four gentlemen of my guard, who will
presently take off their hoods, and serve as witnesses this night in
a little ceremony having reference to my dear Rotrude.”</p>

<p>“A ceremony! this night!” exclaimed the two princesses.</p>

<p>“Ay, by the nails of the cross! Two ceremonies. You shall
both be married forthwith. I will inaugurate my reign by a double
wedding, here in the old palace of Thermes. You, Gisla, shall
espouse Robert, Count de Quercy, and you, Rotrude, shall wed
with Raoul, Baron de Lys. You might have aimed higher,
but they are gallant gentlemen, friends of my deceased sire; and,
by my sooth, the nuptials shall not lack state and ceremony!
Here are our wedding-gifts to the bridegrooms.”</p>

<p>He pointed to two showy suits of armor, the pieces of which were
carried by the four guards. The knights were in a dream of delight.
They vowed eternal gratitude to the most noble of emperors and
unparalleled of brothers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“We have no great faith in human gratitude,” said Louis, “and
shall not expect from you more than is due. And you, my sisters,”
added he, “retire for awhile; put on what you will; but do
not tarry here at the toilette of men-at-arms, like peasant-girls
looking at the equipping of two pikemen.”</p>

<p>The two princesses withdrew; and there would have been a
smile upon their lips, only that they suspected their brother.
Hoping the best, however, they kissed the tips of their rosy fingers
to the knights, and tripped away, like two pets of the ballet. They
were true daughters of their sire, who reckoned love-passages as
even superior to stricken fields. He was not an exemplary father,
nor a faithful husband. His <i>entourage</i> was not of the most respectable;
and in some of his journeys he was attended by the
young wife of one of his own cavaliers, clad in cavalier costume.
It was a villanously reprobate action, not the less so that Hermengarde
was living. The mention of it will disgust every monarch
in Europe who reads my volume; and I am sure that it will produce
no such strong sensation of reproof anywhere as in the bosom
of an admirable personage “over the water.”</p>

<p>The two princesses, then, had not so much trouble from the
prickles of principle as the romances told of them. But, considering
the example set them by their imperial father, they were
really very tolerable princesses, under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“Don your suits, gentlemen!” exclaimed the king.</p>

<p>The four guards advanced with the separate pieces of armor,
at which the two knights gazed curiously for a moment or two,
as two foxes might at a trap in which lay a much-desired felicity.
They were greatly delighted, yet half afraid. The monarch grew
impatient, and the knights addressed themselves at once to their
adornment. They put aside their own armor, and with the assistance
of the four mute gentlemen-at-arms they fitted on the <i>brassards</i>
or arm-pieces, which became them as though the first Milainer
who ever dressed knight had taken their measure. With some
little trouble they were accoutred, less as became bridegrooms than
barons going to battle; and this done, they took their seats, at a
sign from the king, who bade the four gentlemen come to an end
with what remained of the toilette.</p>

<p>The knights submitted, not without some misgiving, to the services<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
of the four mysterious <i>valets</i>! and, in a short time, the
preparations were complete, even to the helmet with the closed
visor. This done, the knights took their places, or were led rather
to two high-backed oaken chairs. As soon as they were seated
there, the four too-officious attendants applied their hands to the
closed head-pieces; and in a very brief space the heads of the
cavaliers sunk gently upon their breasts, as if they were in deep
slumber or as deep meditation.</p>

<p>Two o’clock rang out from the belfry of St. Jacques, as the two
brides entered. The king pointed with a smile to the bridegrooms,
and left the apartment with his attendants. The ladies thought
that the lovers exhibited little ardor or anxiety to meet them; for
they remained motionless on their oaken chairs. The daughters
of Charlemagne advanced, half-timidly, half-playfully; and, at
length, finding the knights not disposed to address them, gently
called to each by his name. Raoul and Robert continued motionless
and mute. They were in fact dead. They had been strangled
or suffocated in a peculiar sort of armor, which had been sent to
Charlemagne from Ravenna, in return for a jewelled vase presented
by that emperor to the ancient city. “In 1560,” says Monsieur
Roger de Beauvoir, himself quoting an Italian manuscript,
there were several researches made in this part of the palace of
Thermes, one result of which was the discovery of a ‘casque à
soufflet,’ all the openings in which could be closed in an instant
by a simple pressure of the finger on a spring. At the same
instant the lower part of the neck-piece tightened round the
throat, and the <i>patient</i> was disposed of. “In this helmet,” adds the
author, “was found the head of a man, well preserved, with beard
and teeth admirable for their beauty.” I think, however, that in
this matter M. de Beauvoir proves a little too much.</p>

<p>Father Daniel, in his history notices the vengeance of Louis le
Debonnaire against two young nobles who were, reputedly, the
lovers of Gisla and Rotrude. The details of the act of vengeance
have been derived from an Italian source; and it is said that an
Italian monk, named Pagnola, had some prominent part in this
dreary drama, impelled thereto by a blow dealt to him at the hands
of Raoul, by way of punishment for some contemptuous phrases
which the monk had presumed to apply to the great Charlemagne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>Love and sword-blades seem to have been as closely connected
as “Trousseaux et Layettes,” which are always named together
in the shop-fronts of a Parisian “Lingere.” There was once an
ample field for the accommodation of both the sentiments of love
and bravery in the old Chaussée d’Antin, when it was merely a
<i>chaussée</i> or highway, and not the magnificent street it now is. It
was, down even to comparatively modern times, the resort of lovers
of every degree, from dukes and duchesses to common dragoons
and dairymaids. They were not always, however, under this
strict classification.</p>

<p>But whatever classification or want of it there may have been,
there was a part of the road which was constantly the scene of
bloody encounters. This was at the narrow bridge of Arcans.
Here if two cavaliers met, each with a lady at his side, it was a
matter of honor not to give way. On the contrary, the latter was
to be forced at the point of the sword. While the champions were
contending, the ladies would scarcely affect to faint; they would
stand aside, remain unconcerned on their jennets or mules, till the
two simpletons had pinked one another; or lounge in their cumbrous
coaches till the lovers limped back to them.</p>

<p>It was on this bridge, of which no vestige now remains, not
even in a museum, that the Count de Fiesque one evening escorting
Madame de Lionne, encountered M. de Tallard, who was chaperoning
Louison d’Arquien. Each couple was in a carriage,
and neither would make way for the other to pass. Thereupon
the two cavaliers leaped from their coaches, drew their swords,
planted their feet firmly on the ground, and began slashing at each
other like two madmen, to the great delight of a large crowd who
enjoyed nothing so much as the sight of two noble gentlemen cutting
one another’s throats.</p>

<p>The ladies, meanwhile, flourished their handkerchiefs from their
respective carriage-windows, for the encouragement of their champions.
Now and then each laughed aloud when her particular
friend had made a more than ordinary successful thrust; and each
was generous enough to applaud any especial dexterity, even when
her own lover thereby bloodily suffered. The two foolish fellows
only poked at each other with the more intensity. And when
they had sufficiently slit their pourpoints and slashed their sleeves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
the ladies, weary of waiting any longer for a more exciting denouement,
rushed between the combatants, like the Sabine ladies
between the contending hosts; each gentleman gallantly kissed
the lady who did not belong to him; and the whole four gayly
supped together, as though they had been the best friends in the
world.</p>

<p>This incident fairly brings us to the questions of duelling and
death, as illustrated by chivalry.</p>

</div>

<div class="verse indent0">“Le duel, ma mie, ne vaut pas un duo, de Lully.”</div>
<div class="verse indent6"><span class="smcap">Crispin Mourant.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">As</span> an effect of chivalry, duelling deserves some passing notice.
Its modern practice was but an imitation of chivalric encounters,
wherein the issue of battle was left to the judgment of God.</p>

<p>Bassompierre dates the origin of duelling (in France) from the
period of Henri II. Previous to that king’s reign, the quarrels
of gentlemen were determined by the decree of the constable and
marshals of France. These only allowed knightly encounters in
the lists, when they could not of themselves decide upon the relative
justice and merits of the dispute.</p>

<p>“I esteem him no gentleman,” said Henri one day, “who has
the lie given him, and who does not chastise the giver.” It was
a remark lightly dropped, but it did not fall unheeded. The king
in fact encouraged those who resorted, of their own will, to a
bloody arbitrament of their dissensions; and duelling became so
“fashionable,” that even the penalty of death levelled against those
who practised it, was hardly effectual enough to check duellists.
At the close of the reign of Henri IV. and the commencement of
that of Louis XIII. the practice was in least activity; but after the
latter period, as the law was not rigorously applied, the foolish
usage was again revived; and sanguinary simpletons washed out
their folly in blood.</p>

<p>But duelling has a more remote origin than that ascribed to it
by Bassompierre. Sabine, in his “Dictionary of Duelling,” a recently-published
American work, dates its rise from the challenge
of the Philistine accepted by David! However this may be, it is
a strange anomaly that an advocate for the savage and sinful habit
of duelling has appeared in that France which claims to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
leader of civilization. Jules Janin has, among his numberless
<i>feuilletons</i> published three reasons authorizing men to appeal to
single combat. The above M. Janin divides the world into three
parts—a world of cravens; a world in which opinion is everything;
and a world of hypocrites and calumniators. He considers
the man who has not the heart to risk his life in a duel, as one
lost in the world of cravens, because the legion of cowards by
whom he is surrounded will assume courage at his expense.</p>

<p>Further, according to our gay neighbor’s reasoning, the man is
lost in this world, in which opinion is everything, who will not
seek to obtain a good opinion at the sword’s point.</p>

<p>Again, says M. Janin, the man is lost in this world of hypocrites
and calumniators who will not demand reparation, sword in
hand, for the calumnies and malicious reports to which he has been
exposed. It would be insulting to the common sense of my readers
to affect to point out to them the rottenness of reasons like
these. They could only convince such men as Buckingham and
Alfieri, and others in circumstances like theirs; Buckingham after
killing Lord Shrewsbury at Barnes, and pressing the head of
Lady Shrewsbury on his bloody shirt; and Alfieri, who, after a
vile seduction, and very nearly a terrible murder in defence of it,
went home and slept more peacefully than he had ever slept
before: “dopo tanto e si stranie peripizie d’un sol giorno, non ho
dormito mai d’un sonno piu tenace e piu dolce.” Alfieri would
have agreed with M. Janin, that in duelling lay the safeguard of
all that remains to us of civilization. But how comes it then that
civilization is thus a wreck, since duelling has been so long exercising
a protective influence over it?</p>

<p>However few, though dazzling, were the virtues possessed by
the chivalrous heroes of ancient history, it must be conceded to
them, that they possessed that of valor, or a disregard of life, in
an eminent degree. The instances of cowardice are so rare that
they prove the general rule of courage; yet these men, with no
guides but a spurious divinity and a false philosophy, never dreamed
of having recourse to the duel, as a means of avenging a private
wrong. Marius, indeed, was once challenged, but it was by
a semi-barbarous Teutonic chief, whom the haughty Roman recommended,
if he were weary of his life to go and hang himself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
Themistocles, too, whose wisdom and courage the most successful
of our modern gladiators may admire and envy, when Eurybiades
threatened to give him a blow, exclaimed, “Strike, but hear me!”
Themistocles, it must be remembered, was a man of undaunted
courage, while his jealous provoker was notorious for little else but
his extreme cowardice.</p>

<p>But, in truth, there have been brave men in all countries, who
have discouraged this barbarous practice. A Turkish pacha reminded
a man who had challenged a fellow Spahi, that they had
no right to slay one another while there were foes to subdue. The
Dauphin of Viennois told the Count of Savoy, who had challenged
him, that he would send the count one of his fiercest bulls, and
that if the count were so minded, his lordship of Savoy might test
his prowess against an antagonist difficult to overcome. The great
Frederick would not tolerate the practice of duelling in his army;
and he thoroughly despised the arguments used for its justification.
A greater man than Frederick, Turenne, would never allow himself
to be what was called “concerned in an affair of honor.”
Once, when the hero of Sintzheim and the Rhine had half drawn
his sword to punish a disgusting insult, to which he had been subjected
by a rash young officer, he thrust it back into the sheath,
with the words: “Young man, could I wipe your blood from my
conscience with as much ease as I can this filthy proof of your
folly from my face, I would take your life upon the spot.”</p>

<p>Even the chivalrous knights who thought duelling a worthy
occupation for men of valor, reduced opportunities for its practice
to a very small extent. Uniting with the church, they instituted
the <i>Savior’s Truce</i>, by which duels were prohibited from Wednesday
to the following Monday, because, it was said, those days had
been consecrated by our Savior’s Passion. This, in fact, left only
Tuesday as a clear day for settling quarrels by force of arms.</p>

<p>There probably never existed a mortal who was opposed by
more powerful or more malignant adversaries than St. Augustin
was. His great enemies the Donatists never, it is true, challenged
him to any more dangerous affray than a war of literary controversy.
But it was in answer to one of their missiles hurled against
him, in the form of an assertion, that the majority of authors was
on their side, he aptly told them that it was the sign of a cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
destitute of truth when only the erring authority of many men
could be relied on.</p>

<p>The Norman knights or chiefs introduced the single combat
among us. It is said they were principally men who had disgraced
themselves in the face of the enemy, and who sought to wipe out
the disgrace in the blood of single individuals. It is worthy of
remark too, that when king and sovereign princes had forbidden
duelling, under the heaviest penalties, the popes absolved the monarchs
from their vows when the observance of them would have
put in peril the lives of offending nobles who had turned to Rome
in their perplexity, and who had gained there a reputation for
piety, as Hector did, who was esteemed so highly religious, for no
other reason than that he had covered with rich gifts the altar of
the father of Olympus.</p>

<p>Supported by the appearance that impunity was to be purchased
at Rome, and encouraged by the example of fighting-cardinals
themselves, duelling and assassination stalked hand in hand abroad.
In France alone, in the brief space of eighteen years, four thousand
gentlemen were killed in <i>rencontres</i>, upon quarrels of the most
trivial nature. In the same space of time, not less than fourteen
thousand pardons for duelling were granted. In one province
alone, of France, in Limousin, one hundred and twenty gentlemen
were slain in six months—a greater number than had honorably
fallen in the same period, which was one of war, in defence of the
sovereign, their country, and their homes. The term <i>rencontre</i>
was used in France to elude the law. If gentlemen “met” by
accident and fought, lawyers pleaded that this was not a <i>duel</i>,
which required preliminaries between the two parties. How frequent
the <i>rencontres</i> were, in spite of the penalty of death, is thus
illustrated by Victor Hugo, in his <i>Marion Delorme</i>:—</p>

<p>Jeremy Taylor denounced this practice with great earnestness,
and with due balancing of the claims of honor and of Christianity.
“Yea; but flesh and blood can not endure a blow or a disgrace.
Grant that too; but take this into the account: flesh and blood
shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”</p>

<p>What man could endure for honor’s sake, however, is shown in
the Memoirs of the Sieur de Pontis, who, in the seventeenth century,
was asked to be second to a friend, when duels were punishable
by death to all parties concerned in them. The friend of De
Pontis pressed it on him, as a custom always practised among
friends; and his captain and lieutenant-colonel did not merely
permit, but ordered him to do what his friend desired.</p>

<p>Boldly as many knights met death, there were not a few who
did their best, and that very wisely, to avoid “the inevitable.”</p>

<p>Valorously as some chevaliers encountered deadly peril, the
German knights, especially took means to avoid the grisly adversary
when they could. For this purpose, they put on the <i>Noth-hemd</i>
or shirt of need. It was supposed to cover the wearer with
invulnerability. The making of the garment was a difficult and
solemn matter. Several maidens of known integrity assembled
together on the eve of the Nativity, and wove and sewed together this
linen garment, in the name of the devil! On the bosom of the
shirt were worked two heads; one was long-bearded and covered
with the knightly helmet, the other was savage of aspect, and
crowned like the king of demons. A cross was worked on either
side. How this could save a warrior from a mortal stroke, it
would be difficult to say. If it was worn over the armor, perhaps
the helmeted effigy was supposed to protect the warrior, and the
demoniacal one to affright his adversary. But then, this shirt
similarly made and adorned, was woven by ladies when about to
become mothers of knights or of common men. What use it could
be in such case, I leave to the “<i>commères</i>” to settle. My own
vocation of “gossip” will not help me to the solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>But if chivalry had its shirts of need in Germany, to save from
death, in England and France it had its “mercy-knives” to swiftly
inflict it. Why they were so called I do not know, for after all
they were only employed in order to kill knights in full armor, by
plunging the knife through the bars of the visor into the eye.
After the battle of Pavia, many of the French were killed with
pickaxes by the peasantry, hacking and hewing through the joints
of the armor.</p>

<p>How anxious were the sires of those times to train their children
how best to destroy life! This was more especially the case
among what were called the “half-christened Irish” of Connaught.
In this province, the people left the right arms of their male infants
unchristened. They excepted that part coming under the divine
influences of baptism, in order that the children, when grown to
the stature of fighting men, might deal more merciless and deadly
blows. There was some such superstitious observance as this, I
think, in ancient Germany. It can not be said, in reference to the
suppressing of this observance, as was remarked by Stow after
the city authorities had put down the martial amusement of the
London apprentices—contending against one another of an evening
with cudgels and bucklers, while a host of admiring maids as
well as men stood by to applaud or censure—that the open pastime
being suppressed, worse practice within doors probably followed.</p>

<p>Stout fellows were some of the knights of the romantic period,
if we may believe half that is recorded of them. There is one,
Branor le Brun, who is famous for having been a living Quintain.
The game so called consists of riding at a heavy sack suspended
on a balanced beam, and getting out of its way, if possible, before
the revolving beam brought it round violently against the back of
the assailant’s head. When Palamedes challenged old Branor,
the aged knight rather scornfully put him aside as an unworthy
yet valiant knight. Branor, however, offered to sit in his saddle
motionless, while Palamedes rode at him, and got unhorsed by
Branor’s mere inert resistance. I forget how many knights
Branor le Brun knocked over their horses’ cruppers, after this
quiet fashion.</p>

<p>It was not all courtesy in battle or in duel. Even Gyron, who
was called the “courteous,” was a very “rough customer” indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
when he had his hand on the throat of an antagonist. We hear
of him jumping with all his force upon a fallen and helpless foe,
tearing his helmet from its fastenings by main force, battering the
knight’s face with it till he was senseless, and then beating on his
head with the pommel of his sword, till the wretched fellow was
dead. At this sort of pommelling there was never knight so expert
as the great Bayard. The courtesy of the most savage in
fight, was however undeniable when a lady was in the case. Thus
we hear of a damsel coming to a fountain at which four knights
were sitting, and one of them wishes to take her. The other three
object, observing that the damsel is without a knight to protect
her, and that she is, therefore, according to the law of chivalry,
exempt from being attacked. And again, if a knight slew an adversary
of equal degree, he did not retain his sword if the latter
was a gift from some lady. The damsel, in such case, could claim
it, and no knight worthy of the name would have thought of refusing
to comply with her very natural request. Even ladies were
not to be won, in certain cases, except by valor; as Arthur, that
king of knights, would not win, nor retain, Britain, by any other
means. The head of Bran the Blessed, it may be remembered,
was hidden in the White Hill, near London, where, as long as it
remained, Britain was invulnerable. Arthur, however removed
it. He scorned to keep the island by any other means than his
own sword and courage; and he was ready to fight any man in
any quarrel.</p>

<p>Never did knight meet death more nobly than that Captain
Douglas, whose heroism is recorded by Sir William Temple, and
who “stood and burnt in one of our ships at Chatham, when his
soldiers left him, because it never should be said a Douglas quitted
his post without orders.” Except as an example of heroic endurance,
this act, however, was in some degree a mistake, for the
state did not profit by it. There was something more profitable in
the act of Von Speyk, in our own time. When hostilities were
raging between Holland and Belgium, in 1831, the young Dutch
captain, just named, happened to be in the Scheldt, struggling in
his gun-boat against a gale which, in spite of all his endeavors and
seamanship, drove him ashore, under the guns of the Belgians.
A crowd of Belgian volunteers leaped aboard, ordered him to haul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
down his colors and surrender. Von Speyk hurried below to the
magazine, fell upon his knees in prayer, flung a lighted cigar into
an open barrel of powder, and blew his ship to atoms, with nearly
all who were on board. If he, by this sacrifice, prevented a
Dutch vessel from falling into the enemy’s power, he also deprived
Holland of many good seamen. The latter country, however, only
thought of the unselfish act of heroism, in one who had been gratuitously
educated in the orphan house at Amsterdam, and who
acquitted his debt to his country, by laying down his life when
such sacrifice was worth making. His king and countrymen
proved that they could appreciate the noble act. The statue of
Von Speyk was placed by the side of that of De Ruyter, and the
government decreed that as long as a Dutch navy existed there
should be <i>one</i> vessel bearing the name of Von Speyk.</p>

<p>To return to the knights of earlier days, I will observe that indifferent
as many of them were to meeting death, they, and indeed
other men of note, were very far from being so as to the manner
in which they should be disposed of <i>after</i> death. In their stone
or marble coffins, they lay in graves so shallow that the cover of
the coffin formed part of the pavement of the church. Whittingham,
the Puritan Dean of Durham, took up many of their coffins
and converted them into horse or swine troughs. This is the dean
who is said to have turned the finely-wrought holy-water vessels
into salting-tubs for his own use.</p>

<p>Modern knights have had other cares about their graves than
that alluded to above. Sir William Browne, for instance, one of
George II.’s knights, and a medical man of some repute, who died
in 1770, ordered by his will that when his coffin was lowered into
the grave, there should be placed upon it, “in <i>its</i> leathern case or
coffin, my pocket Elzevir Horace, comes viæ vitæque dulcis et
utilis, worn out with and by me.” There was nothing more unreasonable
in this than in a warrior-knight being buried with all
his weapons around him. And, with respect to warrior-knights
and what was done with them after death, I know nothing more
curious than what is told us by Stavely on the authority of Streder.
I will give it in the author’s own words.</p>

<p>“Don John of Austria,” says Stavely, “governor of the Netherlands
for Philip II. of Spain, dying at his camp at Buge” (Bouges,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
a mile from Namur), “was carried from thence to the great church
at Havre, where his funeral was solemnized and a monument to
posterity erected for him there by Alexander Farnese, the Prince
of Parma. Afterward his body was taken to pieces, and the bones,
packed in mails, were privately carried into Spain, where, being
set together with small wires, the body was rejointed again, which
being filled or stuffed with cotton, and richly habited, Don John
was presented to the King, entire, leaning upon his commander’s
staff, and looking as if he were alive and breathing. Afterward
the corpse being carried to the Church of St. Laurence, at the
Escurial, was there buried near his father, Charles V., with a fitting
monument erected for him.”</p>

<p>Considering that there was, and is, a suspicion that Philip II.
had poisoned his kinsman, the interview must have been a startling
one. But Philip II. was not, perhaps, so afraid of dead men
as the fourth Spanish king of that name. Philip IV., by no means
an unknightly monarch, was born on a Good Friday, and as there
is a Spanish superstition that they who are born on that day see
ghosts whenever they pass the place where any one has been killed
or buried, who died a violent death, this king fell into a habit of
carrying his head so high, in order to avoid seeing those spirits,
that his nose was continually <i>en l’air</i>, and he appeared to see nobody.</p>

<p>Romance, and perhaps faithful history, are full of details of the
becoming deaths of ancient knights, upon the field. I question,
however, if even Sir Philip Sidney’s was more dignified than that
of a soldier of the 58th infantry, recorded in Nichols’s “Anecdotes
of the Eighteenth Century.” A straggling shot had struck him in
the stomach. As he was too dreadfully wounded to be removed,
he desired his comrades would pray by him, and the whole guard
knelt round him in prayer till he died. Bishop Hurd remarked,
when this was told him, that “it was true religion.” There was
more of religion in such sympathy than there was of taste in the
condolence of Alnwick, on the death of Hugh, Duke of Northumberland—a
rather irascible officer, and Knight of the Garter.
“O,” cried the Alnwick poet—</p>

<p>“Dying in harness,” is a favorite phrase in chivalric annals to
illustrate the bravery of a knight falling in battle, “clothed in complete
steel.” So to die, however, was not always to die in a fray.
Hume says of Seward, Earl of Northumberland, that there are
two circumstances related of him, “which discover his high sense
of honor and martial disposition. When intelligence was brought
to him of his son Osborne’s death, he was inconsolable till he heard
the wound was received on his breast, and that he had behaved
with great gallantry in the action. When he found his own death
approaching, he ordered his servants to dress him in a complete
suit of armor, and sitting erect on the couch, with a spear in his
hand, declared that in that position, the only one worthy of a warrior,
he would patiently await the fatal moment.”</p>

<p>The manner of the death, or rather of the dying of Seward,
Earl of Northumberland, was in part, unconsciously, imitated by
the great Mansfeldt. When the career of the latter was nearly at
its close, his fragile frame was already worn out by excess of action—his
once stout soul irritated by disappointment, and his former
vigorous constitution shattered by the ravages of a disease which
had long preyed on it in secret. The erst gallant knight lay helpless
in the miserable village of Zara, in Dalmatia. As he found
his last moment drawing near, he put on one of his richest uniforms,
and girded his favorite sword to his side. It was the one
he most constantly carried in battle. Thus accoutred, he summoned
his chief officers to attend him. He was held up by the
two whom he most wished to distinguish, because of their unwavering
fidelity. Thus upheld, he exhorted all to go on, unwearied,
in the path of glory; and, living or dying, never to bate a breath
of inveterate hatred for Austria—whose government has been accursed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
in all time, since there has been an Austria, for its unmitigated
infamy. “With the indifference of a man preparing for a
journey of no extraordinary importance,” thus speaks Naylor,
when describing the scene, “he continued tranquilly to converse
with his friends to the latest moment of his existence. His body
was interred with military pomp at Spalatio, in Dalmatia, at the
expense of the Venetians. Thus was the emperor delivered from
an enemy who, though often defeated, never ceased to be formidable;
and whose transcendent genius was so fertile in resources,
that, without the smallest funds to support the expenses of war, he
maintained an honorable contest during seven campaigns against
the most powerful monarchs in Europe.”</p>

<p>With regard to the burial of knights, we may observe that, down
to a comparatively late period the knights and barons of England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
were buried with much solemn splendor. At the obsequies of a
baron, there was an official present who wore the armor of the
defunct, mounted a horse in full trappings, and carried the banner,
shield, and helmet, of the deceased. So, in Henry the Eighth’s
time, Lord William Courtney was buried with the ceremonies observed
at the funeral of an earl, to which rank it had been the
king’s intention to elevate him. On this occasion Sir Edmund
Carew, a gallant knight, rode into the church in full armor, with
the point of his battle-axe downward—a token, like a reversed
torch, of death.</p>

<p>The latest instance I have met with of a union of ancient and
modern customs at the burial of a knight, occurred at Treves, in
1781, at the interment of the Teutonic knight, General Frederick
Casimir. This gallant soldier’s charger was led to the brink of
the grave in which the body had just been deposited; the throat
of the steed was swiftly cut by an official, and the carcass of the
horse was flung down upon the coffin of the knight. Such sacrifices
were once common enough. At the funerals in England of
cavalry soldiers, or of mounted officers, the horse is still processionally
conducted to the brink of the grave, but we are too wisely
economical to leave him there, or to fling him into it.</p>

<p>Where chivalry had great perils and temptations, we need not
be surprised to find that there were many scions of noble houses
who either declined to win spurs by encountering mortal danger,
or who soon grew weary of making the attempt. Let us, then,
consider the unambitious gentlemen who grew “tired of it.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">As</span> marriage or the cloister was the alternative submitted to
most ladies in the days of old, so young men of noble families had
small choice but between the church and chivalry. Some, indeed,
commenced with arms, won knightly honors, cared nothing for
them when they had obtained the prize, and took up the clerical
profession, or entered monasteries. There are many distinguished
examples. There was first St. Mochua or Cluanus, who, after
serving in arms with great distinction, entered a monastery and
took to building churches and establishing cities. Of the former
he built no less than thirty; and he passed as many years in one
church as he had built of churches themselves. He was the founder
of one hundred and twenty cells. He is to be looked upon with
respect. Old warriors in our own days are often moved by the same
impulse which governed Mochua; and when we see retired admirals
taking the chair at meetings where Dr. Cumming is about to
exhibit; or infirm major-generals supporting, with unabated mental
energy, their so-called Puseyite pastors, we only look upon men
who, acting conscientiously, are worthy of respect, and are such
Mochuas as modern times and circumstances will admit of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>We have another example in Adelard, the cousin of Charlemagne.
He was a gay and gallant chevalier at his imperial cousin’s
court, and there was no stouter wielder of a sword in all the
army; but Alard, or Adelard, grew weary of camp and court alike.
He fled from some very pretty temptations in the one, as well as great
perils in the other. The young prince, he was only twenty, took
the monastic habit at Corbie, where he was employed as a gardener,
and spoiled cartloads of vegetables before he got his hand and
his thoughts to his new profession. He was occasionally busy too
in the kitchen, but not to the visible gratification of the monks.
Charlemagne often insisted on his appearing at court, where at last
he held one or two high offices; and, when he left, wrote a book
for the guidance of courtiers generally, by which the latter as little
profited, say wicked wits, as other nobility, for whom a nation has
long prayed that grace, wisdom, and understanding might be their
portion. St. Adelard, for the imperial knight was canonized, lived
to be the chief authority in the monastery where he had commenced
as cook and gardener, and St. Gerard composed an office in his
honor, in gratitude for having been cured of a violent headache
through the saint’s interposition. This seems to me one of the
oddest ways of showing gratitude for a small service that I ever
heard of.</p>

<p>I believe that St. Cedd, Bishop of London, in very early days,
was also of a family whose profession was military. When or
why he entered the church I do not know; but he has some connection
with military matters in the fact that Tilbury Fort occupies
part of the site of a monastery which St. Cedd had founded,
in which he resided, and which was the pride of all the good people
in the then pleasant and prosperous city of Tillabury.</p>

<p>Touching St. Aldric, Bishop of Mans, there is no doubt whatever.
He was of a noble family, and commenced life at twelve
years old, as page to Louis le Debonnaire, at the court of Charlemagne.
He was speedily sick of the court, and as speedily sick
of the camp. At the age of twenty-one he withdrew to Metz, entered
the clerical profession, and became chaplain and confessor to
the sovereign whom he had once served as page. His military
training made him a very sharp disciplinarian during the quarter
of a century that he was bishop; and it is only to be regretted that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
he had not some influence over the king whose conscience he directed,
and of whom a legend will be found in another part of this
volume.</p>

<p>There was a second son of Eric, King of Denmark, known by
the name of St. Knudt or Canute. He was Duke of Schleswig,
and was much more of a monk than a duke. He was canonized
accordingly for his virtues. He had a rough way of joking. His
knights were nothing better than robbers and pirates, and he resolved
to make them forswear violence and live peaceably. They
represented, in vain, that they had a right to live as became
knights, which Canute did not dispute; he simply dissented from
the construction of the right as set down by the knights themselves.
To prevent all mistakes on the matter, he one day condemned
seven of these gentlemen to be hanged for acts of piracy. One of
these exclaimed that, “fitting as the sentence might be for his fellows,
there must necessarily be exemption for him.” He was like
the German corporal in the “Etoile du Nord,” who can very well
understand that it is quite proper that a man should be hanged,
but could <i>not</i> comprehend that <i>he</i> himself should be the man. The
Schleswig knight claimed special exemption on the ground that he
was a kinsman of Canute. The latter allowed that this entitled
him to some distinction, and the saintly duke hung his cousin six
feet higher than any of his accomplices.</p>

<p>We come back more immediately to a knight who grew tired
of his vocation, in the person of Nathalan, a Scottish noble of the
fifth century. He sold arms, horses, and estate, divided the proceeds
among the poor, and devoted himself to preparations for ordination,
and the cultivation of vegetables. He bears a highly
respectable reputation on the roll of Bishops of Aberdeen.</p>

<p>We meet with a man more famous, in Peter of Sebaste, whose
pedigree showed more heroes than could be boasted by any of
Peter’s contemporaries. He is not an example, indeed, of a man
quitting the camp for the cloister; but he and two of his brothers
exhibit to us three individuals who might have achieved great
worldly profit, by adopting arms as a vocation, but who preferred
the Church, and became, all three, bishops.</p>

<p>We have a similar example in the Irish St. Felan. His high
birth and great wealth would have made him the flower of Irish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
chivalry, but he selected another profession, and despising chivalry,
entered the Church. He went <i>a Mundo ad Mundum</i>, for it was
from the hands of Abbot Mundus that he received the monastic
habit. Thus, as it was wittily said, the world (Mundus) at once
drove and drew him into the Church. It is clear, however, that, like
the old war-horse, he pricked up his ears at the sound of battle,
and took an interest in stricken fields. To such conclusion we
must come, if it be true, as is asserted of him, that the battle of
Bannockburn, in 1314, was won by Bruce through the saint’s especial
intercession. The Dukes of Normandy owed equal obligations
to St. Vaneng, who unbuckled the armor from his aristocratic
loins, to cover them with a frock; and built churches for the Normans,
where he offered up continual prayer for the Norman
dukes.</p>

<p>Then again, there was William Berringer, of the family of the
Counts of Nevers. No persuasion could induce the handsome
William to continue in the career he had embraced, the career of
chivalry and arms. His uncle, Peter the Hermit, may have had
considerable influence over him, and his change of profession was
by no means unprofitable, for the once horse-loving William became
Archbishop of Bourges: and he defended the rights of his
Church against kings and councils with as much boldness, zeal,
and gallantry, as any knight could have exhibited against the stoutest
of assailants.</p>

<p>Among our English saints, the one who most nearly resembles
him is St. Egwin, who was of the royal blood of the Mercian kings,
and who, after a short trial of the profession of arms, retired to the
cloister, but was ultimately raised to the see of Worcester. The
spirit of the man may perhaps be seen through the legend which
says that on setting out on a penitential pilgrimage to Rome, he
put iron shackles on his legs, the key of which shackles he flung
into the Avon. This is very possible; but when we are told that
on requiring the key at a subsequent period, he found it inside a
fish, we see that the author of the legend has plagiarized from the
original constructor of the story of Polycrates and his ring.</p>

<p>St. Egwin was far less a benefactor to his fellow-men than St.
Benedict Biscop, a noble knight of the court of Oswi, the pious
king of the Northumbrians. When Benedict, or Bennet, as he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
familiarly called, retired from the profession of arms to follow that
of the Church, he continued quite as active, and twice as useful,
as he had been before. He was a great traveller, spent and gave
liberally, and brought over with him, from the continent, workers
in stone to erect that monastery at Weremouth which, in its ruins,
commemorates his name and deeds. He also brought from France
the first glaziers who ever exercised the art of glass-making in
England. Altogether St. Bennet is one of those who find means
to effect good to others, whatever may be the position they are in
themselves.</p>

<p>Aelred of Ridal was a man of similar quality. He was a young
North-of-England noble, when he figured as the handsomest cavalier
at the court of that “sair saint to the Church,” the Scottish
king, David. He was remarkable for his good temper, and was
as well-disciplined a monk as he had been a military man; for
when he once happened to inadvertently break the rule of permanent
silence, which prevailed in the monastery at Ridal, into
which he entered at the age of twenty-five, he became so horror-stricken
that he was eager to increase the penalty put upon him
in consequence. He had only dropped a single word in the garden,
to a monk who, like himself, had been a knight, but who gave
him in return so edifying a scowl, that in an instant poor Aelred
felt all the depth of his unutterable iniquity, and accounted himself
as criminal as if he had set fire to the neighboring nunnery. He
never afterward allowed himself the indulgence of reading his favorite
Cicero, but confined his reading to his own work “On Spiritual
Friendship,” and other books of a similar description.</p>

<p>The great St. Hilary was another of the men of noble family
following arms as a vocation, who gave up the profession for that
of the Church, and prospered remarkably in consequence. St.
Felix of Nola affords us an additional illustration of this fact. This
noble young soldier found no happiness in the business of slaughtering,
and all the sophistry in the world could not persuade him
that it was honorable. “It is a disgusting business,” said the
Saint, “and as I can not be Felix [happy] in performing it, I will
see if I can not be Felix in the Church;” and the punning saint
found what he sought.</p>

<p>There is something more wonderful in the conversion of St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
Maurus. He was the son of a nobleman, had St. Benedict for a
tutor, and was destined to the career of arms. The tutor, however,
having awoke him one night, and sent him to pick a monk
out of the river, whom Benedict, in a dream, had seen fall in,
Maurus, although no swimmer, obeyed, walked upon the surface
of the water, pulled out the struggling monk, walked back with
him, arm-in-arm, to the shore, and immediately concluded that he
was called to another vocation than that of arms. As for St. John
Calybyte, he would not be a soldier, but ran away from home before
his wealthy sire could procure him a commission, and only
returned to stand, disguised as a mendicant, in front of his father’s
house, where he received alms till he died. A curious example
of idiosyncrasy. St. Honoratus was wiser. He was of a consular
family; but, in declining the military profession, he addressed himself
with sincerity to be useful in the Church; and the well-deserved
result was that he became Archbishop of Arles. St.
Anthony, the patriarch of monks, made still greater sacrifices, and
chose rather to be a hermit than a commander of legions. St.
Sulpicius, the Debonnair, was both rich and good-looking, but he
cared less for helmet and feathers than for cord and cowl, and the
archbishopric of Bourges rewarded his self-denial. There was
more than one King Canute too, who, though not surrendering
royalty and generalship of armies, seemed really more inclined,
and indeed more fitted, to be studious monks than chivalrous monarchs.
Wulstan of Worcester was far more decided, for finding
himself, one night, most warmly admiring the young lady who was
his <i>vis-à-vis</i> in a dance, the gallant officer was so shocked at the
impropriety, that he made it an excuse for taking to the cowl forthwith.
He did not so ill by the exchange, for the cowl brought
him to the mitre at Worcester.</p>

<p>St. Sebastian was a far bolder man, seeing that although he
hated a military life, he, to the very utmost, did his duty in that
state of life to which it had pleased God to call him; and if half
be true of what is told of him, there never was knight of the actual
days of chivalry who performed such bold and perilous actions as
St. Sebastian. What was a cavalier, pricking against a dragon,
to a Roman officer preaching Christianity to his men, under
Diocletian?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>In later days we meet with St. Raymund of Pennafort, the
wealthy young lord, who, rather than serve for pay or plunder,
went about teaching philosophy for nothing. St. John, the Patriarch
of Alexandria, might have been known as a conqueror, but
he preferred being handed down, under the title of the Almoner.
He was like that St. Cadoc who chose rather to be abbot <i>in</i>, than
prince <i>of</i>, Wales. St. Poppo of Stavelo exhibited similar humility.
He was rapidly rising in the Flandrian army when he suddenly
sunk into a cell, and became a sort of Flemish John Wesley.
He preached against all tournaments, but only succeeded in abolishing
the very exciting combats between a knight and a bear,
which were greatly patronized by Flemish ladies, and at which
parties staked great sums upon their favorite animal.</p>

<p>St. Francis of Sales, on the other hand, that gentlemanly saint,
was saved from the knightly career which his noble birth seemed to
promise him, by a vow made by his mother, before he was born.
She was resolved that he should be a saint and not a soldier, and
as all things went as the lady desired, she placed her son in a position
direct for the Church, and the world certainly lost nothing by
the matron’s proceeding. I respect St. Francis of Sales all the
more that he had small human failings, and did not scatter damnation
over men whom he saw in a similar concatenation. Sulpicius
Severus was, in many respects, like him, save that he had some
experience of a soldier’s life. But he laid down the sword for the
pen, and gave us that admirable historical romance, in which he
details so graphically the life of another noble warrior, who quitted
the command of soldiers, to take up the teaching of men—St.
Martin of Tours.</p>

<p>There was a lady, St. Aldegonde, of the royal blood of France,
in the seventh century, who at least encouraged young knights to
abandon their fancied vocation, and assume that of monks or friars.
She was, most undeservedly, I dare say, assailed by scandalizing
tongues accordingly. Indeed, I never heard of lady more persecuted
in this way, except perhaps this particular lady’s namesake,
who once belonged to the gay <i>troupe</i> of the Varietés, and to whom
the most rattling of <i>chansonniers</i> alluded, in the line of a song,
which put the significant query of</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable features in the characters of many
of these young nobles who were disinclined to take up arms, or
who laid them down for the religious vocation, is the dread they
entertained of matrimony. In illustration of this fact, I may notice
the case of St. Silvin of Auchy. There was not a gayer or braver
knight at the court of Childeric II., nor a more welcome wooer
among the ladies. In due time he proposed to a noble maiden,
who was in a flutter of happiness at the thought of carrying off
such a bachelor from a host of competitors. The wedding was
brilliant, up to the conclusion of the ceremony. That over, no
persuasion could induce the bridegroom to go to the breakfast.
As he had been brought to the altar, there he was resolved to remain.
He denounced all weddings as wicked vanities, and darting
out of the church-door, left bride and bridal party to take what
course they would. There was no end of conjectures as to the
cause of the sudden fright which had seized upon the young bridegroom.
The latter set it down to inspiration, and as he took to
the cowl and led a most exemplary life, no one presumed to doubt
it, except the bride and her relations.</p>

<p>The case of St. Licinius is easier of explanation. He was the
most rollicking knight-bachelor at the court of Clotaire I. It
must, however, be said for him that he sowed his wild oats early,
and fought none the less stoutly for going to mass daily, and confessing
once a quarter. He was rich, and had a maiden neighbor
who was richer. The families of knight and maiden were united
in thinking that the estates of the two, encircled in one ring fence,
would be one of the most desirable of consummations. The
maiden was nothing loath, the knight alone was reluctant. He
too, had his doubts about the excellence of marriage, and it was
only with very considerable difficulty he was brought to woo the
lady, who said “Yes” before the plume in his bonnet had touched
the ground when he made his bow to her. The wedding-day was
fixed, and as the old epitaph says, “wedding-clothes provided.”
On the eve of the eventful day, however, Licinius, on paying a
visit to the bride, found her suddenly attacked with leprosy. The
doctor protested that it would be nothing, but Licinius declared
that it was a warning which he dared not neglect. He looked at
the leprous lady, muttered the word “unpleasant,” and at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
betook himself, not to active military life, but to a religious mission.
In this occupation he is alleged to have performed such miracles
as to deserve canonization, if only the half of them were true.</p>

<p>Now, a bride afflicted with leprosy may fairly be said to be an
unpleasant sight. Licinius may even be considered authorized to
hesitate in performing his promise, if not in altogether declaring
off. We can not say as much in extenuation of another knight
who broke his word to a lady, and was clapped into the Roman
calendar of deified men. This gentleman in question had a rather
unchristian-sounding name. He was called Abraham of Chiduna.
At tilt and tournament, and in tented field, there was no cavalier
who sat more perfectly in saddle, or handled his lance and wielded
his battle-axe with more terrible effect. He was of noble birth, of
course; was wealthy, somewhat addicted to light living, in his salad
days, but a man who lived soberly enough when those were over.
He then resolved to marry, and he had the “good taste,” if one
may use a term which, we are told, belongs to the literary milliner’s
vocabulary, to offer himself to, and ask the hand of a very pious
maiden with a highly satisfactory dower. The required conclusion
was soon come to, and one fine spring morning saw the two principals
and their respective friends in church. The knight, it is
true, was the last to arrive, and he had been, previously, as unwilling
to get up and be married, as Master Barnardine was to get
up and be hanged. He was finally brought to the altar, and after
some little delay, such as searching for the ring which he had misplaced,
and only recovered after much search, the nuptial knot
was tied. When this had been accomplished, surrounding friends
approached to offer their congratulations; but the icy Abraham
coldly waved them back, and announced his determination, then
and there, to end his short-lived married state. As he immediately
rushed into the wood which was in the vicinity of the church,
there was a universal cry that he contemplated suicide. The
bride was conveyed home amid much sympathy, and a general
but an ineffectual search was made for the “groom.” Yet, not
altogether ineffectual, for at the end of seventeen days he was discovered,
offering up his orisons, in the midst of a marsh. There
he had been, he said, for a fortnight, and there he declared he
would remain, unless those who sought him consented to the terms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
he should propose. These were, that he should be allowed to
retire to a cell which should be entirely walled up, save a small
square aperture for a window. The agreement was ratified, and
Abraham was shut up according to his desire; and by a long life
of seclusion, passed in preaching to all who approached the window,
and taking in all they brought through the same aperture,
Abraham has had “Beatus” attached to his name, and that name
has been recorded upon the roll of saints.</p>

<p>If there be any reader who objects to this story as unnatural, I
would remark to the same, that similar incidents may be met with
in our own time. In proof thereof I will briefly relate an anecdote
which was told me by the reverend father of a legal knight, who
was himself the officiating minister at the ceremony of which I
am about to speak.</p>

<p>To the clergyman of a pretty village in Wales, due notice had
been given, and all preliminary legal observances having been
fulfilled, he awaited in his vestry, ready to marry an ex-sergeant
and one of the girls of the village. The canonical hours were
fast gliding away, and yet the priest was not summoned to the
altar. By certain sounds he could tell that several persons had
assembled in the church, and he had two or three times seen a
pretty face peeping in at the vestry-door, with a look upon it of
pleasure to see that he was still there, and of perplexity as if there
was something to be told which only waited to be asked for. At
half-past eleven the face again peeped in, whereupon the clergyman
invited the owner of it to approach nearer. The invitation
was obeyed, and the clergyman inquired the reason for the unusual
delay, remarking at the same time, that if the parties were
not speedily prepared it would be too late to perform the ceremony
that day.</p>

<p>“Well sir,” said the nymph, “I was about asking your advice.
I am the bride’s sister; and there is a difficulty—”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the priest.</p>

<p>“Just this, sir,” said Jenny. “Sergeant Jones has promised to
marry sister Winnifred if father will put down five pounds.
Father agrees; but he says that if he puts down the money before
the marriage, the sergeant will walk off. And the sergeant will
not come up to be married till the money is put down. So, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
see, sir, we are in a terrible difficulty; and we want you to propose
a method to get us out of it.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing easier,” said the minister; “let your father
put the money into the hands of a trusty third person, who will
promise to place it in the sergeant’s possession as soon as he has
married your sister.”</p>

<p>Jenny Morgan saw the excellence of the device in a moment,
rushed back to the bridal parties, and they showed their appreciation
of the clergyman’s suggestion, by crowding to the altar as
soon as the preliminary proceeding recommended to them had
been accomplished. At length the clergyman came to the words,
“Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife?”</p>

<p>“Jack,” said the ex-sergeant, looking round at the stake-holder,
“have you got the cash?”</p>

<p>“All right!” nodded Jack.</p>

<p>“Then I will,” said the sergeant; “and now, Jack, hand over
the <i>tin</i>.”</p>

<p>The agreement was rigidly fulfilled; but had not the minister
thought of the means which solved the difficulty, Sergeant Jones
would have been nearly as ungallant to his lady as Abraham,
Silvin, and Licinius, had been to theirs.</p>

<p>But to return to Abraham. I have said this knight, on assuming
his monkly character, had caused himself to be walled up in his
cell. I have my suspicions, however, that it was a theatrical sort
of wall, for it is very certain that the saint could pass through it.
Now, there resided near him a lady recluse who was his “niece,”
and whose name was Mary. The two were as inseparable as the
priest Lacombe and Madame Guyon; and probably were as little
deserving of reproach. This Mary was the original of “Little
Red Riding Hood.” She used to convey boiled milk and butter,
and other necessary matters to her uncle Abraham. Now it happened
that the ex-knight used also to be visited by a monk whose
name was Wolf, or who, at all events, has been so called by hagiographers,
on account of his being quite as much of a beast as the
quadruped so called. The monk was wont to fall in with Mary
as she was on her way to her uncle’s cell with pleasant condiments
under a napkin, in a wicker-basket. He must have been a monk
of the Count Ory fashion, and he was as seductive as Ponchard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
when singing “Gentille Annette” to the “Petit Chaperon Rouge,”
in Boieldieu’s Opera. The result was, that the monk carried off
Mary to a neighboring city—Edessa, if I remember rightly—and
if I am wrong, Mr. Mitchell Kemble will, perhaps, set me right,
in his bland and gentleman-like way. The town-life led by these
two was of the most disgraceful nature; and when the monk had
grown tired of it, he left Mary to lead a worse, without him.
Mary became the “Reine Pomare,” the “Mogadore,” the “Rose
Pomponne” of Edessa, and was the terror of all families where
there were elder sons and latch-keys. Her doings and her whereabouts
at length reached the ears of her uncle Abraham, and not
a little astonished were those who knew the recluse to see him one
morning, attired in a pourpoint of rich stuff, with a cloak like
Almaviva’s, yellow buskins with a fall of lace over the tops, a
jaunty cap and feather on his head, a rapier on his thigh, and a
steed between his legs, which curveted under his burden as though
the fun of the thing had given it lightness. At Mary’s supper,
this cavalier was present on the night of his arrival in Edessa.
He scattered his gold like a Crœsus, and Mary considered him
worth all the more penniless knights put together. When these
had gone, as being less welcome, Abraham declared his relationship,
and acted on the right it gave him to rate a niece who was
not only an ungrateful minx, but who was as mendacious as an
ungrateful niece could well be. The old gentleman, however, had
truth on his side, and finally so overwhelmed Mary with its terrible
application, that she meekly followed him back to the desert, and
passed fifteen years in a walled-up cell close to that of her uncle.
The miracles the two performed are adduced as proofs of the
genuineness of the personages and their story; matters which I
would not dispute even if I had room for it.</p>

<p>The next knight whom I can call to mind as having been frightened
by marriage into monkery, is St. Vandrille, Count of the
Palace to King Dagobert. During the period of his knightship
he was a very Don Juan for gallantry, and railed against matrimony
as conclusively as a Malthusian. His friends pressed him
to marry nevertheless; and introduced him to a lady with a hundred
thousand golden qualities, and prospects as auriferous as those
of Miss Kilmansegg. He took the lady’s hand with a reluctance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
that might be called aversion, and which he did not affect to conceal.
When the nuptial ceremony was concluded, Knight Vandrille,
as eccentric as the cavaliers whose similar conduct I have
already noticed, mildly intimated that it was not his intention to
proceed further, and that for his part, he had renounced the vanities
of this world for aye. Taking the lady apart, he appears to
have produced upon <i>her</i> a conviction that the determination was
one he could not well avoid; and we are not told that she even
reproached him for a conduct which seems to me to have been a
thousand times more selfish and inexcusable than that of the clever
but despicable Abelard. The church, however, did not disapprove
of the course adopted, and St. Vandrille, despite his worse than
breach of promise, has been forgiven as knight, and canonized as
saint.</p>

<p>Far more excusable was that little Count of Arian, Elzear, the
boy-knight at the court of Charles II., King of Sicily, whom that
monarch married at the age of thirteen years, to Delphina of
Glandeves, a young lady of fifteen. When I say far more excusable,
I do Elzear some injustice, for the boy was willing enough
to be wed, and looked forward to making his lady proud of his
own distinction as a knight. Delphina, however, it was who proposed
that they should part at the altar, and never meet again.
She despised the boy, and the little cavalier took it to heart—so
much so, that he determined to renounce the career of arms and
enter the church. Thereby chivalry lost a worthy cavalier, and
the calendar gained a very active saint.</p>

<p>Elzear might well feel aggrieved. There have been knights
even younger than he, who have carried spurs before they were
thirteen. This reminds me of a paragraph in an article which I
contributed to “Fraser’s Magazine,” in March, 1844, under the
title of “A Walk across Bohemia,” in which, speaking of the
Imperial Zeughaus at Vienna, I noticed “the suit of armor of that
little hero, the second Louis of Hungary, he who came into this
breathing world some months before he was welcome, and who
supported his character for precocity by marrying at twelve, and
becoming the legitimate bearer of all the honors of paternity as
soon as he entered his teens; who moreover maintained his consistency
by turning a gray old man at sixteen, and finally terminated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
his ephemeral course on the field of battle before he became
of age.” Elzear then was not, perhaps, so poor a knight as his
older lady seemed disposed to count him.</p>

<p>I must be briefer with noticing the remaining individuals who
either flung up chivalry for the Church, or who preferred the latter
to following a knightly career. First, there was St. Anscharius,
who after he had made the change alluded to, was standing near
the easy Olas, King of Sweden, when the latter cast lots to decide
whether Christianity should be the religion of the state, or not.
We are told that the prayers of St. Anscharius caused the king to
throw double-sixes in favor of the better cause.</p>

<p>St. Andrew Cossini made an admirable saint after being the
most riotous of cavaliers. So St. Amandus of Nantes won his
saintship by resigning his lordship over men-at-arms. Like him
was that St. Romuald of the family of the Dukes of Ravenna, who,
whether fighting or hunting, loved to retire from the fray and the
chase, to pray at peace, in shady places. St. John of Malta and
St. Stephen of Grandmont were men of the like kidney. St. Benedict
of Anian was that famous cup-bearer of Charlemagne, who
left serving the Emperor in hall and field, to serve a greater master
with less ostentation. He followed the example of that St.
Auxentius, who threw up his commission in the equestrian guard
of Theodosius the Younger, to take service in a body of monks.</p>

<p>Many of those who renounced arms, or would not assume military
service when opportunity offered itself, profited personally by
the adoption of such a course. Thus St. Porphyrius was a knight
till he was twenty-five years of age, and he died Bishop of Gaza.
The knight St. Wulfran became Bishop of Sens. St. Hugh won
the bishopric of Grenoble, by not only renouncing knighthood himself,
but by inducing his father to follow his example. St. Norbert
became Archbishop of Magdeburg, after leading a jolly life, not
only as a knight but as priest. A fall from his horse brought him
to a sense of decency. A prophecy of a young maiden to St. Ulric
gained him his saintship and the bishopric of Augsburg. Had she
not foretold he would die a bishop, he would have been content
to carry a banner. Examples like these are very numerous, but
I have cited enough.</p>

<p>Few in a worldly sense made greater sacrifice than St. Casimir,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
son of Casimir III., King of Poland. He so loved his reverend
tutor, Dugloss, that, to be like him, he abandoned even his chance
of the throne, and became a priest. St. Benedict of Umbria took
a similar course, upon a smaller scale; and not all the persuasions
of his nurse, who ran after him when he ran away from home,
could induce him to be anything but a priest. St. Herman Joseph,
of Cologne, showed how completely he had abandoned the knightly
character, when, as monk, he begged the peasants whom he taught,
to be good enough to buffet him well, and cuff him soundly, as it
was impossible for him to have a sufficiency of kicks and contempt.
St. Guthlac, the noble hermit of Croyland, evinced more dignity
in his retirement, and the same may be said of St. Peter Regalati,
and St. Ubaldus of Gabio. The latter was resolute neither to
marry nor take arms. He liked no turmoil, however qualified.
St. Vincent of Lerins <i>did</i> bear arms for years, but he confessed he
did not like the attendant dangers—threatening him spiritually,
not bodily, and he took the cowl and gained a place in the sacred
calendar accordingly. St. Aloysius Gonzaga, whose father was a
prince, was another of the young gentlemen for whom arms had
little attraction. The humility of this young gentleman, however,
had a very silly aspect, if it all resembled what is said of him by
Father Caperius. “He never looked on women, kept his eye
strictly guarded, and generally cast down; would never stay with
his mother alone in her chamber, and if she sent in any message
to him by some lady in her company, he received it, and gave his
answer in a few words, with his eyes shut, and his chamber-door
only half open; and when bantered on that score, he ascribed such
behavior to his bashfulness. It was owing to his original modesty
that he did not know by their face many ladies among his own relations,
with whom he had frequently conversed; and that he was
afraid and ashamed to let a footman see so much as his foot uncovered.”
Whatever the soft Aloysius may have been fit for, it is
clear that he was <i>not</i> fit for chivalry. Something akin to him
was St. Theobald of Champagne, who probably would never have
been a saint, if his father had not ordered him to lead a body of
troops to the succor of a beleaguered cousin. Theobald declined,
and at once went into a monastery.</p>

<p>St. Walthen, one of the sons of the Earl of Huntingdon, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
Maud, daughter of Judith, which Judith was the niece of the Conqueror,
only narrowly escaped being a gallant knight. As a boy,
indeed, he used to build churches with his box of bricks, while
his brothers built castles; but at least he gave promise of being
a true knight, and, once, not only accepted the gift of a ring from
a lady, but wore the sparkling diamond on his finger. “Ah! ah!”
exclaimed the saucy courtiers, “Knight Walthen is beginning to
have a tender heart for the ladies!” Poor Walthen! he called
this a devil’s chorus, tossed the ring into the fire, broke the lady’s
heart, and went into a monastery for the remainder of his days.
He escaped better than St. Clarus, who had a deaf ear and stone-blind
eyes for the allurements of a lady of quality, and who only
barely escaped assassination, at the hands of two ruffians hired by
the termagant to kill the man who was above allowing her holy
face to win from him a grin of admiration. But though I could
fill a formidable volume with names of <i>ci-devant</i> knights who have
turned saints, I will spare my readers, and conclude with the great
name of St. Bernard. He did not, indeed, take up arms, but when
he adopted a religious profession, he enjoyed the great triumph of
inducing his uncle, all his brothers, knights, and simple officers, to
follow his example. The uncle Gualdri, a famous swordsman and
seigneur of Touillon, was the first who was convinced that Bernard
was right. The two younger brothers of the latter, Bartholomew
and Andrew, next knocked off their spurs and took to their breviary.
Guy, the eldest brother, a married man, of wealth, broke
up his household, sold his armor, sent his lady to a convent and
his daughters to a nunnery, put on the cowl, and followed St. Bernard.
Others of his family and many of his friends followed his
example, with which I conclude my record of saints who have had
any connection with arms. As for St. Bernard, I <i>will</i> say of him,
that had he assumed the sword and been as merciless to his enemies
as he was, in his character of abbot, without bowels of compassion
for an adversary whom he could crush by wordy argument,
he would have been the most terrible cavalier that ever sat
in saddle!</p>

<p>Perhaps the most perfect cavalier who ever changed that dignity
for the cowl, was the Chevalier de Rancé. Of him and his
Trappist followers I will here add a few words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>


<p class="c">THE CHEVALIER DE RANCE AND THE TRAPPISTS.</p>

<p>De Rancé was born in 1626. He was of a ducal house, and
the great Cardinal de Richelieu was his godfather. In his youth
he was very sickly and scholastic. He was intended for the
Church, held half a score of livings before he could speak—and
when he <i>could</i> express his will, resolved to live only by his sword.
He remained for a while neither priest nor swordsman, but simply
the gayest of libertines. He projected a plan of knight-errantry,
in society with all the young cavaliers, and abandoned the project
to study astrology. For a period of some duration, he was half-knight,
half-priest. He then received full orders, dressed like the
most frivolous of marquises, seduced the Duchess de Montbazon,
and absolved in others the sins which he himself practised.
“Where are you going?” said the Chevalier de Champvallon to
him one day. “I have been preaching all the morning,” said De
Rancé, “like an angel, and I am going this afternoon to hunt like
the very devil.” He may be said to have been like those Mormons
who describe their fervent selves as “Hell-bent on Heaven!”</p>

<p>Nobody could ever tell whether he was soldier or priest, till
death slew the Duchess de Montbazon. De Rancé unexpectedly
beheld the corpse disfigured by the ravages of small-pox or measles,
and he was so shocked, that it drove him from the world to
the cloister, where, as the reconstructor, rather than the founder,
of the order of Trappists, he spent thirty-seven years—exactly as
many as he had passed in the “world.”</p>

<p>The companions and followers of the chivalrous De Rancé claim
a few words for themselves. The account will show in what strong
contrasts the two portions of their lives consisted. They had
learned obedience in their career of arms, but they submitted to a
far more oppressive rule in their career as monks. Some century
and a half ago there was published in Paris a dreadfully dreary
series of volumes, entitled “Relations de la Vie et de la Mort de
quelques Religieux de l’Abbaye de la Trappe.” They consist
chiefly of tracts, partly biographical and partly theological, uninteresting
in the main, but of interest as showing what noble soldiers
or terrible freebooters asked for shelter in, and endured the
austerities of, La Trappe. I have alluded to the unreserved submission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
required at the hands of the brothers. The latter, according
to the volumes which I have just named, were sworn to impart
even their <i>thoughts</i> to the Abbot. They who thus delivered themselves
with least reserve appear to have been commanded in very
bad Latin; but their act of obedience was so dear to Heaven, that
their persons became surrounded with a glory, which their less communicative
brethren, says the author naïvely, could not possibly
gaze at for any length of time:—the which I implicitly believe.</p>

<p>The candidates for admission included, without doubt, many
very pious persons, but with them were degraded priests, with
whom we have little to do, and ex-officers, fugitive men-at-arms,
robbers who had lived by the sword, and murderers, of knightly
degree, who had used their swords to the unrighteous slaying of
others, and who sought safety within the cloisters of La Trappe.
All that was asked of them was obedience. Where this failed it
was compelled. Where it abounded it was praised. Next to it
was humility. One brother, an ex-soldier reeking with blood, is
lauded because he lived on baked apples, when his throat was too
sore to admit of his swallowing more substantial food. Another
brother, who had changed arms for the gown, is most gravely compared
with Moses, because he was never bold enough to enter the
pantry with sandals on his feet. Still, obedience was the first
virtue eulogized—so eulogized that I almost suspect it to have
been rare. It was made of so much importance, that the community
were informed that all their faith, and all their works, without
blind obedience to the superior, would fail in securing their salvation.
Practical blindness was as strongly enjoined. He who used
his eyes to least purpose, was accounted the better man. One ex-military
brother did this in so praiseworthy a way, that in eight
years he had never seen a fault in any of his brethren.</p>

<p>It was not, however, this sort of blindness that De Rancé required,
for he encouraged the brethren to bring accusations against
each other. Much praise is awarded to a brother who never looked
at the roof of his own cell. Laudation more unmeasured is poured
upon another faithful knight of the new order of self-negation,
who was so entirely unaccustomed to raise his eyes from the ground,
that he was not aware of the erection of a new chapel in the garden,
until he broke his head against the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>On one occasion the Duchess de Guiche and an eminent prelate
visited the monastery together. After they had left, a monk entered
the Abbot’s apartment, threw himself at the feet of his
superior, and begged permission to confess a great crime. He
was told to proceed.</p>

<p>“When the lady and the bishop were here just now,” said he,
“I dared to raise my eyes, and they rested upon the face—”</p>

<p>“Not of the lady, thou reprobate!” exclaimed the Abbot.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” calmly rejoined the monk, “but of the old bishop!”
A course of bread and water was needed to work expiation for
the crime.</p>

<p>Some of the brethren illustrated what they meant by obedience
and humility, after a strange fashion. For example, there was
one who having expressed an inclination to return to the world,
was detained against his will. His place was in the kitchen, and
the devastation he committed among the crockery was something
stupendous—and probably not altogether unintentional. He was
not only continually fracturing the delf earthenware dishes, but
was incessantly running from the kitchen to the Abbot, from the
Abbot to the Prior, from the Prior to the Sub-Prior, and from the
Sub-Prior to the Master of the Novices to confess his fault.
Thence he returned to the kitchen again, once more to smash
whole crates of plates, following up the act with abundant confessions,
and deriving evident enjoyment, alike in destroying the
property, and assailing with noisy apologies the governing powers
whom he was resolved to inspire with a desire of getting rid
of him.</p>

<p>In spite of forced detention there was a mock appearance of
liberty at monthly assemblies. The brethren were asked if there
was anything in the arrangement of the institution and its rules
which they desired to see changed. As an affirmative reply, however,
would have brought “penance” and “discipline” on him who
made it, the encouraging phrase that “They had only to speak,”
by no means rendered them loquacious, and every brother, by his
silence, expressed his content.</p>

<p>If death was the suicidal object of many, the end appears to
have been generally attained with a speedy certainty. The superiors
and a few monks reached an advanced age; only a few of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
the brethren died old men. Consumption, inflammation of the
lungs, and abscess (at memory of the minute description of which
the very heart turns sick), carried off the victims with terrible
rapidity. Men entered, voluntarily or otherwise, in good health.
If they did so, determined to achieve suicide, or were driven in
by the government with a view of putting them to death, the end
soon came, and was, if we may believe what we read, welcomed
with alacrity. After rapid, painful, and unresisted decay, the sufferer
saw as his last hour approached, the cinders strewn on the
ground in the shape of a cross; a thin scattering of straw was
made upon the cinders, and that was the death-bed upon which
every Trappist expired. The body was buried in the habit of the
order, as some knights have been in panoply, without coffin or
shroud, and was borne to the grave in a cloth upheld by a few
brothers. If it fell into its last receptacle with huddled-up limbs,
De Rancé would leap into the grave and dispose the unconscious
members, so as to make them assume an attitude of repose.</p>

<p>A good deal of confusion appears to have distinguished the rules
of nomenclature. In many instances, where the original names
had impure or ridiculous significations, the change was advisable.
But I can not see how a brother became more cognisable as a
Christian, by assuming the names of Palemon, Achilles, Moses, or
even Dorothy. Theodore, I can understand; but Dorothy, though
it bears the same meaning, seems to me but an indifferent name
for a monk, even in a century when the male Montmorencies delighted
in the name of “Anne.”</p>

<p>None of the monks were distinguished by superfluous flesh.
Some of these ex-soldiers were so thin-skinned, that when sitting
on hard chairs, their bones fairly rubbed through their very slight
epidermis. They who so suffered, and joyfully, were held up as
bright examples of godliness.</p>

<p>There is matter for many a sigh in these saffron-leaved and
worm-eaten tomes, whose opened pages are now before me. I find
a monk who has passed a sleepless night through excess of pain.
To test his obedience, he is ordered to confess that he has slept
well and suffered nothing. The submissive soldier obeys his general’s
command. Another confesses his readiness, as Dr. Newman
has done, to surrender any of his own deliberately-made convictions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
at the bidding of his superior. “I am wax,” he says, “for
you to mould me as you will and his unreserved surrender of
himself is commended with much windiness of phrase. A third,
inadvertently remarking that his scalding broth is over-salted,
bursts into tears at the enormity of the crime he has committed
by thus complaining; whereupon praise falls upon him more
thickly than the salt did into his broth: “Yes,” says the once
knight, now abbot, “it is not praying, nor watching, nor repentance,
that is alone asked of you by God, but humility and obedience
therewith; and <i>first</i> obedience.”</p>

<p>To test the fidelity of those professing to have this humility and
obedience, the most outrageous insults were inflicted on such as in
the world had been reckoned the most high-spirited. It is averred
that these never failed. The once testy soldier, now passionless
monk, kissed the sandal raised to kick, and blessed the hand lifted
to smite him. A proud young officer of mousquetaires, of whom
I have strong suspicions that he had embezzled a good deal of his
majesty’s money, acknowledged that he was the greatest criminal
that ever lived; but he stoutly denied the same when the officers
of the law visited the monastery and accused him of fraudulent
practices. This erst young warrior had no greater delight than
in being permitted to clean the spittoons in the chapel, and provide
them with fresh sawdust. Another, a young marquis and
chevalier, performed with ecstacy servile offices of a more disgusting
character. This monk was the flower of the fraternity. He
was for ever accusing himself of the most heinous crimes, not one
of which he had committed, or was capable of committing. “He
represented matters so ingeniously,” says De Rancé, who on this
occasion is the biographer, “that without lying, he made himself
pass for the vile wretch which in truth he was not.” He must
have been like that other clever individual who “lied like truth.”</p>

<p>When I say that he was the flower of the fraternity, I probably
do some wrong to the Chevalier de Santin, who under the name
of Brother Palemon, was undoubtedly the chief pride of La
Trappe. He had been an officer in the army; without love for
God, regard for man, respect for woman, or reverence for law. In
consequence of a rupture between Savoy and France, he lost an
annuity on which he had hitherto lived. As his constitution was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
considerably shattered, he at the same time took to reading. He
was partially converted by perusing the history of Joseph; and
he was finally perfected by seeing the dead body of a very old
and very ugly monk, assume the guise and beauty of that of a
young man.</p>

<p>This was good ground for conversion; but the count—for the
chevalier of various orders was of that degree by birth—the count
had been so thorough a miscreant in the world, that they who lived
in the latter declined to believe in the godliness of Brother Palemon.
Thereupon he was exhibited to all comers, and he gave
ready replies to all queries put to him by his numerous visiters.
All France, grave and gay, noble and simple, flocked to the spectacle.
At the head of them was that once sovereign head of the
Order of the Garter, James II., with his illegitimate son, from
whom is descended the French ducal family of Fitz-James. The
answers of Palemon to his questioners edified countless crowds.
He shared admiration with another ex-military brother, who guilelessly
told the laughing ladies who flocked to behold him, that he
had sought refuge in the monastery because his sire had wished
him to marry a certain lady; but that his soul revolted at the
idea of touching even the finger-tips of one of a sex by the first
of whom the world was lost. The consequent laughter was
immense.</p>

<p>From this it is clear that there were occasionally gay doings at
the monastery, and that those at least who had borne arms, were
not addicted to close their eyes in the presence of ladies. Among
the most remarkable of the knightly members of the brotherhood,
was a certain Robert Graham, whose father, Colonel Graham, was
first cousin to Montrose. Robert was born, we are told, in the
“Chateau de Rostourne,” a short league (it is added by way of
help, I suppose, to perplexed travellers), from Edinburgh. By
his mother’s side he was related to the Earl of Perth, of whom the
Trappist biographer says, that he was even more illustrious for
his piety, and for what he suffered for the sake of religion, than
by his knighthood, his viceroyship, or his offices of High Chancellor
of England, and “Governor of the Prince of Wales, now
(1716) rightful king of Great Britain.” The mother of Robert,
a zealous protestant, is spoken of as having “as much piety as one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
<i>can</i> have in a false religion.” In spite of her teaching, however,
the young Robert early exhibited an inclination for the Romish
religion; and at ten years of age, the precocious boy attended
mass in the chapel of Holyrood, to the great displeasure of his
mother. On his repeating his visit, she had him soundly whipped
by his tutor; but the young gentleman declared that the process
could not persuade him to embrace Presbyterianism. He accordingly
rushed to the house of Lord Perth, “himself a recent convert
from the Anglican Church,” and claimed his protection.
After some family arrangements had been concluded, the youthful
protégé was formally surrendered to the keeping of Lord Perth,
by his mother, and not without reluctance. His father gave him
up with the unconcern of those Gallios who care little about
questions of religion.</p>

<p>Circumstances compelled the earl to leave Scotland, when
Robert sojourned with his mother at the house of her brother, a
godly protestant minister. Here he showed the value of the instructions
he had received at the hands of Lord Perth and his
Romish chaplain, by a conduct which disgusted every honest man,
and terrified every honest maiden, in all the country round. His
worthy biographer is candid enough to say that Robert, in falling
off from Popery, did not become a protestant, but an atheist.
The uncle turned him out of his house. The prodigal repaired
to London, where he rioted prodigally; thence he betook himself
to France, and he startled even Paris with the bad renown of his
evil doings. On his way thither through Flanders, he had had a
moment or two of misgiving as to the wisdom of his career, and
he hesitated while one might count twenty, between the counsel
of some good priests, and the bad example of some Jacobite soldiers,
with whom he took service. The latter prevailed, and when
the chevalier Robert appeared at the court of St Germains, Lord
Perth presented to the fugitive king and queen there, as accomplished
a scoundrel as any in Christendom.</p>

<p>There was a show of decency at the exiled court, and respect
for religion. Young Graham adapted himself to the consequent
influences. He studied French, read the lives of the saints, entered
the seminary at Meaux, and finally reprofessed the Romish
religion. He was now seized with a desire to turn hermit, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
accident having taken him to La Trappe, the blasé libertine felt
himself reproved by the stern virtue exhibited there, and, in a
moment of enthusiasm, he enrolled himself a postulant, bade farewell
to the world, and devoted himself to silence, obedience, humility,
and austerity, with a perfectness that surprised alike those who
saw and those who heard of it. Lord Perth opposed the reception
of Robert in the monastery. Thereon arose serious difficulty, and
therewith the postulant relapsed into sin. He blasphemed, reviled
his kinsmen, swore oaths that set the whole brotherhood in speechless
terror, and finally wrote a letter to his old guardian, so
crammed with fierce and unclean epithets, that the abbot refused
permission to have it forwarded. The excitement which followed
brought on illness; with the latter, came reflection and sorrow.
At length all difficulties vanished, and ultimately, on the eve of All
Saints, 1699, Robert Graham became a monk, and changed his
name for that of Brother Alexis. King James visited him, and
was much edified by the spiritual instruction vouchsafed him by
the second cousin of the gallant Montrose. The new monk was
so perfect in obedience that he would not in winter throw a crumb
to a half-starved sparrow, without first applying for leave from his
spiritual superior. “Indeed,” says his biographer, “I could tell
you a thousand veritable stories about him; but they are so extraordinary
that I do not suppose the world would believe one of
them.” The biographer adds, that Alexis, after digging and cutting
wood all day; eating little, drinking less, praying incessantly, and
neither washing nor unclothing himself, lay down; but to pass the
night without closing his eyes in sleep! He was truly a brother
Vigilantius.</p>

<p>The renown of his conversion had many influences. The father
of Alexis, Colonel Graham, embraced Romanism, and the colonel
and an elder son, who was already a Capuchin friar, betook themselves
to La Trappe, where the reception of the former into the
church was marked by a double solemnity—De Rancé dying as
the service was proceeding. The wife of Colonel Graham is said
to have left Scotland on the receipt of the above intelligence, to
have repaired to France, and there embrace the form of faith followed
by her somewhat facile husband. There is, however, great
doubt on this point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>The fate of young Robert Graham was similar to that of most
of the Trappists. The deadly air, the hard work, the watchings,
the scanty food, and the uncleanliness which prevailed, soon slew
a man who was as useless to his fellow-men in a convent, as he
had ever been in the world. His confinement was, in fact, a swift
suicide. Consumption seized on the poor boy, for he was still but
a boy, and his rigid adherence to the severe discipline of the place,
only aided to develop what a little care might have easily checked.
His serge gown clove to the carious bones which pierced through
his diseased skin. The portions of his body on which he immovably
lay, became gangrened, and nothing appears to have been
done by way of remedy. He endured all with patience, and looked
forward to death with a not unaccountable longing. The “infirmier”
bade him be less eager in pressing forward to the grave.—“I
will now pray God,” said the nursing brother, “that he will be
pleased to save you.”—“And I,” said Alexis, “will ask him not
to heed you.” Further detail is hardly necessary: suffice it to say
that Robert Graham died on the 21st May, 1701, little more than
six months after he had entered the monastery, and at the early
age of twenty-two years. The father and brother also died in
France, and so ended the chivalrous cousins of the chivalrous
Montrose.</p>

<p>The great virtue inculcated at La Trappe, was one of the cherished
virtues of old chivalry, obedience to certain rules. But there
was no excitement in carrying it out. Bodily suffering was encountered
by a knight, for mere glory’s sake. At La Trappe it
was accounted as the only means whereby to escape Satan. The
knight of the cross purchased salvation by the sacrifice of his life;
the monk of La Trappe, by an unprofitable suicide. With both
there was doubtless the one great hope common to all Christians;
but that great hope, so fortifying to the knight, seemed not to relieve
the Trappist of the fear that Satan was more powerful than
the Redeemer. When once treating this subject at greater length,
I remarked that there was a good moral touching Satan in Cuvier’s
dream, and the application of which might have been profitable to
men like these monks. The great philosopher just named, once
saw, in his sleep, the popular representative of the great enemy of
man. The fiend approached with a loudly-expressed determination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
to “eat him.” “Eat me!” exclaimed Cuvier, examining him the
while with the eye of a naturalist. “Eat me! Horns! Hoofs!”
he added, scanning him over. “Horns? Hoofs? <i>Graminivorous!</i>
needn’t be afraid of you!”</p>

<p>And now let us get back from the religious orders of men to
chivalrous orders of ladies. It is quite time to exclaim, <i>Place aux
Dames!</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap large">Orders</span> for ladies” have been favorite matters with both Kings
and Queens, Emperors and Empresses. The Austrian Empress,
Eleanora de Gonzague, founded two orders, which admitted only
ladies as members. The first was in commemoration of the miraculous
preservation of a particle of the true cross, which escaped
the ravages of a fire which nearly destroyed the imperial residence,
in 1668. Besides this Order of the Cross, the same Empress instituted
the Order of the Slaves of Virtue. This was hardly a
complimentary title, for a slave necessarily implies a compulsory
and unwilling servant. The number of members were limited to
thirty, and these were required to be noble, and of the Romish religion.
The motto was, <i>Sole ubique triumphat</i>; which may have
implied that she only who best served virtue, was likely to profit
by it. This was not making a very exalted principle of virtue itself.
It was rather placing it in the point of view wherein it was
considered by Pamela, who was by far too calculating a young
lady to deserve all the eulogy that has been showered upon her.</p>

<p>Another Empress of Germany, Elizabeth Christiana, founded,
in the early part of the last century, at Vienna, an Order of Neighborly
Love. It consisted of persons of both sexes; but nobody
was accounted a neighbor who was not noble. With regard to
numbers, it was unlimited. The motto of the order was <i>Amor
Proximi</i>; a motto which exactly characterized the feelings of
Queen Guinever for any handsome knight who happened to be
her neighbor for the nonce. “Proximus” at the meetings of the
order was, of course, of that convenient gender whereby all the
members of the order could profit by its application. They might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
have had a particularly applicable song, if they had only possessed
a Béranger to sing as the French lyrist has done.</p>

<p>There was also in Germany an order for ladies only, that was
of a very sombre character. It was the Order of Death’s Head;
and was founded just two centuries ago, by a Duke of Wirtemburg,
who decreed that a princess of that house should always be at the
head of it. The rules bound ladies to an observance of conduct
which they were not likely to observe, if the rule of Christianity
was not strong enough to bind them; and probably many fair ladies
who wore the double cross, with the death’s head pending from
the lower one, looked on the motto of “Memento Mori,” as a reminder
to daring lovers who dared to look on <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>France had given us, in ladies’ orders, first, the Order of the
Cordelière, founded by that Anne of Brittany who brought her independent
duchy as a dower to Charles VIII. of France, and who
did for the French court what Queen Charlotte effected for that
of England, at a much later period. Another Anne, of Austria,
wife of Louis XIII., and some say of Cardinal Mazarin also, founded,
for ladies, the Order of the Celestial Collar of the Holy Rosary.
The members consisted of fifty young ladies of the first families in
France; and they all wore, appended to other and very charming
insignia hanging from the neck, a portrait of St. Dominic, who
found himself in the best possible position for instilling all sorts of
good principles into a maiden’s bosom.</p>

<p>The Order of the Bee was founded a century and a half ago by
Louisa de Bourbon, Duchess of Maine. The ensign was a medal,
with the portrait of the duchess on one side, and the figure of a
bee, with the motto, <i>Je suis petite, mais mes piqueures sont profondes</i>,
on the other.</p>

<p>In Russia, Peter the Great founded the Order of St. Catherine,
in honor of his wife, and gave as its device, <i>Pour l’amour et la
fidélité envers la patrie</i>. It was at first intended for men, but was
ultimately made a female order exclusively. A similar change
was found necessary in the Spanish Order of the Lady of Mercy,
founded in the thirteenth century by James, King of Aragon.
There were other female orders in Spain, and the whole of them
had for their object the furtherance of religion, order, and virtue.
In some cases, membership was conferred in acknowledgment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
merit. Who forgets Miss Jane Porter in her costume and insignia
of a lady of one of the orders of Polish female chivalry—and who
is ignorant that Mrs. Otway has been recently decorated by the
Queen of Spain with the Order of Maria Louisa?</p>

<p>The Order of St. Ulrica, in Sweden, was founded in 1734, in
honor of a lady, the reigning Queen, and to commemorate the liberty
which Sweden had acquired and enjoyed from the period of
her accession. Two especial qualities were necessary in the candidates
for knighthood in this order. It was necessary that a public
tribunal should declare that they were men of pure public spirit;
and it was further required of them to prove that in serving the
country, they had never been swayed by motives of private interest.
When the order was about to be founded, not less than five
hundred candidates appeared to claim chivalric honor. Of these,
only fifty were chosen, and decree was made that the number of
knights should never exceed that amount. It was an unnecessary
decree, if the qualifications required were to be stringently demanded.
But, in the conferring of honors generally, there has
often been little connection between cause and effect; as, for instance,
after Major-General Simpson had failed to secure the victory
which the gallantry of our troops had put in his power at the
Redan, the home government was so delighted, that they made
field-marshals of two very old gentlemen. The example was not
lost on the King of the Belgians. He, too, commemorated the fall
of Sebastopol by enlarging the number of his knights. He could
not well scatter decorations among his army, for that has been
merely a military police, but he made selection of an equally destructive
body, and named eighteen doctors—Knights of St.
Leopold.</p>

<p>These orders of later institution appear to have forgotten one
of the leading principles of knighthood—love for the ladies—but
perhaps this is quite as well. When Louis II., Duke of Bourbon,
instituted the Order of the Golden Shield, he was by no means so
forgetful. He enjoined his knights to honor the ladies above all,
and never permit any one to slander them with impunity; “because,”
said the good duke, “after God, we owe everything to the
labors of the ladies, and all the honor that man can acquire.” One
portion of which assertion may certainly defy contradiction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>The most illustrious of female knights, however, is, without dispute,
the Maid of Orleans. Poor Jeanne Darc seems to me to
have been an illustrious dupe and an innocent victim. Like Charlotte
Corday, the calamities of her country weighed heavily upon
her spirits, and her consequent eager desire to relieve them, caused
her to be marked as a fitting instrument for a desired end. Poor
Charlotte Corday commissioned herself for the execution of the
heroic deed which embellishes her name—Jeanne Darc was evidently
commissioned by others.</p>

<p>The first step taken by Jeanne to obtain access to the Dauphin,
was to solicit the assistance of the proud De Baudricourt, who resided
not far from the maid’s native place, Domremy. However
pious the young girl may have been, De Baudricourt was not the
man to give her a public reception, had not some foregone conclusion
accompanied it. She needed his help to enable her to proceed
to Chinon. The answer of the great chief was that she should
not be permitted to go there. The reply of the maid, who was
always uncommonly “smart” in her answers, was that she <i>would</i>
go to Chinon, although she were forced to crawl the whole way
on her knees. She <i>did</i> go, and the circumstances of a mere young
girl, who was in the habit of holding intercourse with angels and
archangels, thus overcoming, as it were, the most powerful personage
in the district, was proof enough to the common mind, as to
whence she derived her strength and authority. The corps of
priests by whom she was followed, as soon as her divine mission
was acknowledged or invented by the court, lent her additional
influence, and sanctified in her own mind, her doubtless honest enthusiasm.
The young girl did all to which she pledged herself,
and in return, was barbarously treated by both friend and foe, and
was most hellishly betrayed by the Church, under whose benediction
she had raised her banner. She engaged to relieve Orleans
from the terrible English army which held it in close siege, and
she nobly kept her engagement. It may be noticed that the first
person slain in this siege, was a young lady named Belle, and the
fair sex thus furnished the first victim, as well as the great conqueror,
in this remarkable conflict.</p>

<p>I pass over general details, in order to have the more space to
notice particular illustrative circumstances touching our female<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
warrior. Jeanne, it must be allowed, was extremely bold of assertion
as well as smart in reply. She would have delighted a Swedenborgian
by the alacrity with which she protested that she held
intercourse with spirits from Heaven and prophets of old. Nothing
was so easy as to make her believe so; and she was quite as
ready to deny the alleged fact when her clerical accusers, in the
day of her adversity, declared that such belief was a suggestion of
the devil. I think there was some humor and a little reproach in
the reply by Jeanne, that she would maintain or deny nothing but
as she was directed by the Church.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during her short but glorious career, she manifested
true chivalrous spirit. She feared no man, not even the brave
Dunois. “Bastard, bastard!” said she to him on one occasion,
“in the name of God, hear me; I command you to let me know
of the arrival of Fastolf as soon as it takes place; for, hark ye, if
he passes without my knowledge, I give you my word, you shall
lose your head.” And thereon she turned to her dinner of dry
bread and wine-and-water—half a pint of the first to two pints of
the last, with the quiet air of a person able and determined to realize
every menace.</p>

<p>It is very clear that her brother knights, while they profited by
her services, and obeyed (with some reluctance) her orders, neither
thought nor spoke over-well of her. Their comments were
not complimentary to a virgin reputation, which a jury of princesses,
with a queen for a forewoman, had pronounced unblemished.
She even risked her <i>prestige</i> over the common rank and
file, but generally by measures which resulted in strengthening it.
Thus, on taking the Fort of the Augustins from the English, she
destroyed all the rich things and lusty wine she found there, lest
the men should be corrupted by indulgence therein. It may be
remembered that Gustavus Vasa highly disgusted his valiant
Dalecarlians by a similar exhibition of healthy discipline.</p>

<p>The Maid undoubtedly placed the work of fighting before the
pleasure of feasting. When she was about to issue from her lodgings,
to head the attack against the bastion of the Tourelles, where
she prophesied she would be wounded, her host politely begged of
her to remain and partake of a dish of freshly-caught shad. It
was the 7th of May, and shad was just in season; the Germans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
call it distinctively “the May-fish.” Jeanne resisted the temptation
for the moment. “Keep the fish till to-night,” said she, “till
I have come back from the fray; for I shall bring a Goden [a
‘God d—n,’ or Englishman] with me to partake of my supper.”</p>

<p>She was not more ready of tongue than she was quick of eye.
An instance of the latter may be found in an incident before Jargeau.
She was reconnoitring the place at a considerable distance.
The period was more than a century and a half before Hans Lippershey,
the Middleburg spectacle-maker, had invented, and still
more before Galileo had improved, the telescope. The Duke
d’Alençon was with Jeanne, and she bade him step aside, as the
enemy were pointing a gun at him. The Duke obeyed, for he
knew her acuteness of vision; the gun was fired, and De Lude, a
gentleman of Anjou, standing in a line with the spot which had
been occupied by the Duke, was slain—which must have been
very satisfactory to the Duke!</p>

<p>I have said that some of the knights had but a scanty respect
for the gallant Maid. A few, no doubt, objected to the assumption
of heavenly inspiration on her part. One, at least, was not so
particular. I allude to the Baron De Richemond, who had been
exiled from court for the little misdemeanor of having assassinated
Cannes de Beaulieu. The Baron had recovered his good name by
an actively religious exercise, manifested by his hunting after wizards
and witches, and burning them alive, to the delight and edification
of dull villagers. This pious personage paid a visit to Jeanne,
hoping to obtain, by her intercession, the royal permission to have
a share in the war. The disgraced knight, who brought with him
a couple of thousand men, when these were most wanted, was not
likely to meet with a refusal of service, and the permission sought
for was speedily granted. Jeanne playfully alluded to her own
supernatural inspiration and the Baron’s vocation as “witch-finder.”
“Ah well,” said De Richemond, “with regard to yourself, I have
only this to say, that it is difficult to say anything; but if you are
from Heaven, it is not I who shall be afraid of you; and if you
come from the devil, I do not fear even him, who, in such case,
sends you.” Thereupon, they laughed merrily, and began to talk
of the next day’s battle.</p>

<p>That battle was fought upon the field of Patay, where the gallant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
Talbot was made prisoner by the equally gallant Saintrailles.
When the great English commander was brought into the presence
of Jeanne, he was good-humoredly asked if he had expected
such a result the day before. “It is the fortune of war,” philosophically
exclaimed the inimitable John; and thereby he made a
soldier’s comment, which has often since been in the mouths of the
valiant descendants of the French knights who heard it uttered,
and which is frequently quoted as being of Gallic origin. But,
again, I think that “fortuna belli” was not an uncommon phrase,
perhaps, in old days before the French language was yet spoken.</p>

<p>And here, talking of origin, let me notice a circumstance of some
interest. Jeanne Darc is commonly described as Jeanne D’Arc,
as though she had been ennobled. This, indeed, she was, by the
King, but not by that name. To the old family name was added
that of <i>du Lys</i>, in allusion to the Lily of France, which that family
had served so well. The brothers of Jeanne, now Darc du Lys,
entered the army. When Guise sent a French force into Scotland,
some gallant gentlemen of this name of Lys were among
them. They probably settled in Caledonia, for the name is not an
uncommon one there; and there is a gallant major in the 48th who
bears it, and who, perhaps, may owe his descent to the ennobled
brothers of “The Maid of Orleans.”</p>

<p>Jeanne was not so affected as to believe that nobility was above
the desert of her deeds. When her relatives, including her brothers,
Peter and John, congratulated her and themselves on all that
she had accomplished, her remark was: “My deeds are in truth
those of a ministry; but in as great truth never were greater read
of by cleric, however profound he may be in all clerical learning.”
The degree of nobility allowed to the deserving girl was that of a
countess. Her household consisted of a steward, almoner, squire,
pages, “hand, foot, and chamber men,” independently of the noble
maidens who tended her, and who seem to have been equally
served by three “valets de main, de pied, et de chambre.”</p>

<p>But short-lived was the glory; no, I will not say <i>that</i>, let me
rather remark that short-lived was the worldly splendor of the
chivalrous my-lady countess. She had rendered all the service
she could, when she fell wounded before Paris, and was basely
abandoned for a while by her own party. She was rescued, ultimately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
by D’Alençon, but only to be more disgracefully abandoned
on the one side, and evilly treated on the other. When as
a bleeding captive she was rudely dragged from the field at Compiègne;
church, court, and chivalry, ignobly abandoned the poor
and brave girl who had served all three in turn. By all three she
was now as fiercely persecuted; and it may safely be said, that
if the English were glad to burn her as a witch, to account for the
defeat of the English and their allies, the French were equally
eager to furnish testimony against her.</p>

<p>Her indecision and vacillation after falling into the hands of her
enemies, would seem to show that apart from the promptings of
those who had guided her, she was but an ordinary personage.
She, however, never lost heart, and her natural wit did not
abandon her. “Was St. Michael naked when he appeared to
you?” was a question asked by one of the examining commissioners.
To which Jeanne replied, “Do you think heaven has not
wherewith to dress him?” “Had he any hair on his head?” was
the next sensible question. Jeanne answered it by another query,
“Have the goodness to tell me,” said she, “why Michael’s head
should have been shaved?” It was easy, of course, to convict a
prejudged and predoomed person, of desertion of her parents, of
leading a vagabond and disreputable life, of sorcery, and finally,
of heresy. She was entrapped into answers which tended to prove
her culpability; but disregarding at last the complicated web woven
tightly around her, and aware that nothing could save her, the
heart of the knightly maiden beat firmly again, and as a summary
reply to all questions, she briefly and emphatically declared: “All
that I have done, all that I do, I have done well, and do well to do
it.” In her own words, “Tout ce que j’ai fait, tout ce que je fais,
j’ai bien fait, et fais bien de le faire;” and it was a simply-dignified
<i>resume</i> in presence of high-born ecclesiastics, who did not scruple
to give the lie to each other like common ploughmen.</p>

<p>She was sentenced to death, and suffered the penalty, as being
guilty of infamy, socially, morally, religiously, and politically. Not
a finger was stretched to save her who had saved so many. Her
murder is an indelible stain on two nations and one church; not
the less so that the two nations unite in honoring her memory, and
that the church has pronounced her innocent. Never did gallant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
champion meet with such base ingratitude from the party raised
by her means from abject slavery to triumph; never was noble
enemy so ignobly treated by a foe with whom, to acknowledge
and admire valor, is next to the practice of it; and never was
staff selected by the church for its support, so readily broken and
thrown into the fire when it had served its purpose. All the sorrow
in the world can not wash out these terrible facts, but it is
fitting that this sorrow should always accompany our admiration.
And so, honored be the memory of the young girl of Orleans!</p>

<p>After all, it is a question whether our sympathies be not thrown
away when we affect to feel for Jeanne Darc. M. Delepierre, the
Belgian Secretary of Legation, has printed, for private circulation,
his “Doute Historique.” This work consists chiefly of official
documents, showing that the “Maid” never suffered at all, but that
some criminal having been executed in her place, she survived to
be a pensioner of the government, a married lady, and the mother
of a family! The work in which these documents are produced,
is not to be easily procured, but they who have any curiosity in
the matter will find the subject largely treated in the <i>Athenæum</i>.
This “Historical Doubt” brings us so closely in connection with
romance, that we, perhaps, can not do better in illustrating our
subject, than turn to a purely romantic subject, and see of what
metal the champions of Christendom were made, with respect to
chivalry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">I can</span> hardly express the delight I feel as a biographer in the
present instance, in the very welcome fact that no one knows anything
about the parentage of St. George. If there had been a
genealogical tree of the great champion’s race, the odds, are that I
should have got bewildered among the branches. As there is
only much conjecture with a liberal allowance of assertion, the
task is doubly easy, particularly as the matter itself is of the very
smallest importance.</p>

<p>The first proof that our national patron ever existed at all, according
to Mr. Alban Butler, is that the Greeks reverenced him
by the name of “the Great Martyr.” Further proof of a somewhat
similar quality, is adduced in the circumstance that in Greece
and in various parts of the Levant, there are or were dozens of
churches erected in honor of the chivalrous saint; that Georgia
took the holy knight for its especial patron; and that St. George, in
full panoply, won innumerable battles for the Christians, by leading
forward the reserves when the vanguard had been repulsed by the
infidels, and the Christian generals were of themselves too indolent,
sick, or incompetent, to do what they expected St. George to
do for them.</p>

<p>From the East, veneration for this name, and some imaginary
person who once bore it, extended itself throughout the West.
It is a curious fact, that long before England placed herself under
the shield of this religious soldier, France had made selection of
him, at least as a useful adjutant or aide-de-camp to St. Denis.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
Indeed, our saint was at one time nearly monopolized by France.
St. Clotilde, the wife of the first Christian king of France, raised
many altars in his honor—a fact which has not been forgotten in
the decorations and illustrative adornments of that splendid church
which has just been completed in the Faubourg St. Germain, and
which is at once the pride and glory of Paris. That city once
possessed relics which were said to be those of St. George; but
of their whereabouts, no man now knows anything. We do, however,
know that the Normans brought over the name of the saint
with them, as that of one in whose arm of power they trusted,
whether in the lists or in battle. In this respect <i>we</i>, as Saxons,
if we choose to consider ourselves as such, have no particular reason
to be grateful to the saint, for his presence among us is a symbol
of national defeat if not of national humiliation. Not above
six centuries have, however, elapsed since the great council of
Oxford appointed his feast to be kept as a holyday of lesser rank
throughout England; and it is about five hundred years since
Edward III. established the Order of the Garter, under the patronage
of this saint. This order is far more ancient than that of
St. Michael, instituted by Louis XI.; of the Golden Fleece, invented
by that ‘good’ Duke Philip of Burgundy, who fleeced all
who were luckless enough to come within reach of his ducal shears;
and of the Scottish Order of St. Andrew, which is nearly two
centuries younger than that of St. George. Venice, Genoa, and
Germany, have also instituted orders of chivalry in honor of this
unknown cavalier.</p>

<p>These honors, however, and a very general devotion prove nothing
touching his birth, parentage, and education. Indeed, it is
probably because nothing is known of either, that his more serious
biographers begin with his decease, and write his history, which,
like one of Zschokke’s tales, might be inscribed “Alles Verkerht.”
They tell us that he suffered under Diocletian, in Nicomedia, and
on the 23d of April. We are further informed that he was a
Cappadocian—a descendant of those savagely servile people, who
once told the Romans that they would neither accept liberty at the
hands of Rome, nor tolerate it of their own accord. He was, it
is said, of noble birth, and after the death of his father, resided
with his mother in Palestine, on an estate which finally became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
his own. The young squire was a handsome and stalwart youth,
and, like many of <i>that</i> profession, fond of a military life. His
promotion must have been pretty rapid, for we find him, according
to tradition, a tribune or colonel in the army at a very early age,
and a man of much higher rank before he prematurely died. His
ideas of discipline were good, for when the pagan emperor persecuted
the Christians, George of Cappadocia resigned his commission
and appointments, and not till then, when he was a private
man, did he stoutly remonstrate with his imperial ex-commander-in-chief
against that sovereign’s bloody edicts and fiercer cruelty
against the Christians. This righteous boldness was barbarously
avenged; and on the day after the remonstrance the gallant soldier
lost his head. Some authors add to this account that he was the
“illustrious young man” who tore down the anti-Christian edicts,
when they were first posted up in Nicomedia, a conjecture which,
by the hagiographers is called “plausible,” but which has no
shadow of proof to give warrant for its substantiality.</p>

<p>The reason why all knights and soldiers generally have had
confidence in St. George, is founded, we are told, on the <i>facts</i> of
his reappearance on earth at various periods, and particularly at
the great siege of Antioch, in the times of the crusades. The
Christians had been well nigh as thoroughly beaten as the Russians
at Silistria. They were at the utmost extremity, when a
squadron was seen rushing down from a mountain defile, with three
knights at its head, in brilliant panoply and snow-white scarfs.
“Behold,” cried Bishop Adhemar, “the heavenly succor which
was promised to you! Heaven declares for the Christians. The
holy martyrs, George, Demetrius, and Theodore, come to fight for
you.” The effect was electrical. The Christian army rushed to
victory, with the shout, “It is the will of God!” and the effect of
the opportune appearance of the three chiefs and their squadron,
who laid right lustily on the Saracens, was decisive of one of the
most glorious, yet only temporarily productive of triumphs.</p>

<p>When Richard I. was on his expedition against enemies of the
same race, he too was relieved from great straits by a vision of
St. George. The army, indeed, did not see the glorious and inspiring
sight, but the king affirmed that <i>he</i> did, which, in those
credulous times was quite as well. In these later days men are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
less credulous, or saints are more cautious. Thus the Muscovites
assaulted Kars under the idea that St. Sergius was with them; at
all events, Pacha Williams, a good cause, and sinewy arms, were
stronger than the Muscovite idea and St. Sergius to boot.</p>

<p>Such, then, is the hagiography of our martial saint. Gibbon
has sketched his life in another point of view—business-like, if not
matter-of-fact. The terrible historian sets down our great patron
as having been born in a fuller’s shop in Cilicia, educated (perhaps)
in Cappadocia, and as having so won promotion, when a young
man, from his patrons, by the skilful exercise of his profession as
a parasite, as to procure, through their influence, “a lucrative commission
or contract to supply the army with bacon!” In this
commissariat employment he is said to have exercised fraud and
corruption, by which may be meant that he sent to the army bacon
as rusty as an old cuirass, and charged a high price for a worthless
article. In these times, when the name and character of St.
George are established, it is to be hoped that Christian purveyors
for Christian armies do not, in reverencing George the Saint, imitate
the practices alleged against him as George the Contractor.
It would be hard, indeed, if a modern contractor who sent foul hay
to the cavalry, uneatable food to the army generally, or poisonous
potted-meat to the navy, could shield himself under the name
and example of St. George. Charges as heavy <i>are</i> alleged against
him by Gibbon, who adds that the malversations of the pious rogue
“were so notorious, that George was compelled to escape from the
pursuit of justice.” If he saved his fortune, it is allowed that he
made shipwreck of his honor; and he certainly did not improve
his reputation if, as is alleged, he turned Arian. The career of
our patron saint, as described by Gibbon, is startling. That writer
speaks of the splendid library subsequently collected by George,
but he hints that the volumes on history, rhetoric, philosophy, and
theology, were perhaps as much proof of ostentation as of love for
learning. That George was raised by the intrigues of a faction
to the pastoral throne of Athanasius, in Alexandria, does not surprise
us. Bishops were very irregularly elected in those early
days, when men were sometimes summarily made teachers who
needed instruction themselves; as is the case in some enlightened
districts at present. George displayed an imperial pomp in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
archiepiscopal character, “but he still betrayed those vices of his
base and servile extraction,” yet was so impartial that he oppressed
and plundered all parties alike. “The merchants of Alexandria,”
says the historian of the “Decline and Fall,” “were impoverished
by the unjust and almost universal monopoly which he acquired
of nitre, salt, paper, funerals, &amp;c., and the spiritual father of a
great people condescended to practise the vile and pernicious arts
of an informer. He seems to have had as sharp an eye after the
profit to be derived from burials, as a certain archdeacon, who
thinks intramural burial of the dead a very sanitary measure for
the living, and particularly profitable to the clergy. Thus the example
of St. George would seem to influence very “venerable” as
well as very “martial” gentlemen. The Cappadocian most especially
disgusted the Alexandrians by levying a house tax, of his
own motion, and as he pillaged the pagan temples as well, all parties
rose at length against the common oppressor and “under the
reign of Constantine he was expelled by the fury and justice of
the people.” He was restored only again to fall. The accession
of Julian brought destruction upon the archbishop and many of
his friends, who, after an imprisonment of three weeks, were
dragged from their dungeons by a wild and cruel populace, and
murdered in the streets. The bodies were paraded in triumph
upon camels (as that of Condé was by his Catholic opponents,
after the battle of Jarnac, on an ass), and they were ultimately
cast into the sea. This last measure was adopted in order that, if
the sufferers were to be accounted as martyrs, there should at least
be no relics of them for men to worship. Gibbon thus concludes:
“The fears of the Pagans were just, and their precautions ineffectual.
The meritorious death of the archbishop obliterated the
memory of his life. The rival of Athanasius was dear and sacred
to the Arians, and the seeming conversion of those sectaries introduced
his worship into the bosom of the Catholic church. The
odious stranger, disguising every circumstance of time and place,
assumed the rank of a martyr, a saint, and a Christian hero; and
the infamous George of Cappadocia has been transformed into the
famous St. George of England, the patron of arms, of chivalry,
and of the garter.”</p>

<p>The romancers have treated St. George and his knightly confraternity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
after their own manner. As a sample of what reading
our ancestors were delighted with, especially those who loved chivalric
themes, I know nothing better than “The Famous History
of the Seven Champions of Christendom, St. George of England,
St. Denis of France, St. James of Spain, St. Anthony of Italy, St.
Andrew of Scotland, St. Patrick of Ireland, and St. David of
Wales. Shewing their honourable battles by sea and land. Their
tilts, justs, tournaments for ladies; their combats with gyants, monsters,
and dragons; their adventures in foreign nations; their enchantments
in the Holy Land; their knighthoods, prowess, and
chivalry, in Europe, Africa, and Asia; with their victories against
the enemies of Christ; also the true manner and places of their
deaths, being seven tragedies, and how they came to be called the
Seven Saints of Christendom.” The courteous author or publisher
of the veracious details, prefaces them with a brief address “to
all courteous readers,” to whom “Richard Johnson wisheth increase
of virtuous knowledge.” “Be not,” he says, “like the chattering
cranes, nor Momus’s mates that carp at everything. What the
simple say, I care not. What the spiteful say, I pass not; only
the censure of the conceited,” by which good Richard means the
learned, “I stand unto; that is the mark I aim at,”—an address,
it may be observed, which smacks of the Malaprop school; but
which seemed more natural to our ancestors than it does to us.</p>

<p>For these readers Richard Johnson presents a very highly-spiced
fare. He brings our patron saint into the world by a Cæsarean
operation performed by a witch, who stole him from his unconscious
mother, and reared him up in a cave, whence the young
knight ultimately escaped with the other champions whom the
witch, now slain, had kept imprisoned. The champions, it may
be observed, travel with a celerity that mocks the “Express,” and
rivals the despatch of the Electric Telegraph. They are scarcely
departed from the seven paths which led from the brazen pillar,
each in search of adventures, when they are all “in the thick of
it,” almost at the antipodes. A breath takes St. George from
Coventry, his recovered home, after leaving the witch, to Egypt.
At the latter place he slays that terrible dragon, which some think
to imply the Arian overcoming the Athanasian, and rescues the
Princess Sabra, in whose very liberal love we can hardly trace a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
symbol of the Church, although her antipathies are sufficiently
strong to remind one of the <i>odium theologicum</i>. George goes on
performing stupendous feats, and getting no thanks, until he undertakes
to slay a couple of lions for the Soldan of Persia, and gets
clapped into prison, during seven years, for his pains. The biographer
I suspect, shut the knight up so long, in order to have an
excuse to begin episodically with the life of St. Denis.</p>

<p>The mystic number seven enters into all the principal divisions
of the story. Thus, St. Denis having wandered into Thessaly
was reduced to such straits as to live upon mulberries; and these
so disagreed with him that he became suddenly transformed into a
hart; a very illogical sequence indeed. But the mulberry tree
was, in fact, Eglantius the King’s daughter, metamorphosed for
her pride. Seven years he thus remained; at the end of which
time, his horse, wise as any regularly-ordained physician, administered
to him a decoction of roses which brought about the transformation
of both his master and his master’s mistress into their
“humane shapes.” That they went to court sworn lovers may be
taken as a matter of course. There they are left, in order to afford
the author an opportunity of showing how St. James, having most
unorthodoxically fallen in love with a Jewish maiden, was seven
years dumb, in consequence. St. James, however, is a patient and
persevering lover. If I had an ill-will against any one I would counsel
him to read this very long-winded history, but being at peace
with all mankind, I advise my readers to be content with learning
that the apostolic champion and the young Jewess are ultimately
united, and fly to Seville, where they reside in furnished lodgings,
and lead a happy life;—while the author tells of what befell to
the doughty St. Anthony.</p>

<p>This notable Italian is a great hand at subduing giants and
ladies. We have a surfeit of combats and destruction, and love-making
and speechifying, in this champion’s life; and when we
are compelled to leave him travelling about with a Thracian lady,
who accompanies him, in a theatrical male dress, and looks in it
like the Duchess—at least, like Miss Farebrother, in the dashing
white sergeant of the Forty Thieves—we shake our head at St.
Anthony and think how very unlike he is to his namesake in the
etching by Callot, where the fairest of sirens could not squeeze a
sigh from the anchorite’s wrinkled heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>While they are travelling about in the rather disreputable fashion
above alluded to, we come across St. Andrew of Scotland, who
has greater variety of adventure than any other of the champions.
With every hour there is a fresh incident. Now he is battling
with spirits, now struggling with human foes, and anon mixed up,
unfavorably, with beasts. At the end of all the frays, there is—we
need hardly say it—a lady. The bonny Scot was not likely
to be behind his fellow-champions in this respect. Nay, St. Andrew
has six of them, who had been swans, and are now natural
singing lasses. What sort of a blade St. Andrew was may be
guessed by the “fact,” that when he departed from the royal court,
to which he had conducted the half dozen ladies, they all eloped
in a body, after him. There never was so dashing a hero dreamed
of by romance—though a rhymer <i>has</i> dashed off his equal in
wooing, and Burns’s “Finlay” is the only one that may stand the
parallel.</p>

<p>When the six Thracian ladies fall into the power of “thirty
bloody-minded satyrs,” who so likely, or so happy to rescue them
as jolly St. Patrick. How he flies to the rescue, slays one satyr,
puts the rest to flight, and true as steel, in love or friendship, takes
the half dozen damsels under his arm, and swings singingly along
with them in search of the roving Scot! As for St. David, all this
while, he had not been quite so triumphant, or so tried, as his fellows.
He had fallen into bad company, and “four beautiful damsels
wrapped the drousie champion in a sheet of fine Arabian silk, and
conveyed him into a cave, placed in the middle of a garden, where
they laid him on a bed, more softer than the down of Culvers.”
In this agreeable company the Welsh champion wiled away <i>his</i>
seven years. It was pleasant but not proper. But if the author
had not thus disposed of him, how do you think he would ever
have got back to St. George of England? The author indeed exhibits
considerable skill, for he brings St. George and St. David
together, and the first rescues the second from ignoble thraldom,
and what is worse, from the most prosy enchanter I ever met with
in history, and who is really not enchanting at all. This done,
George is off to Tripoli.</p>

<p>There, near there, or somewhere else, for the romances are
dreadfully careless in their topography, he falls in with his old love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
Sabra, married to a Moorish King. If George is perplexed at
this, seeing that the lady had engaged to remain an unmarried
maiden till he came to wed her, he is still more so when she informs
him that she has, in all essentials, kept her word, “through the
secret virtue of a golden chain steeped in tiger’s blood, the which
she wore seven times double about her ivory neck.” St. George
does not know what to make of it, but as on subsequently encountering
two lions, Sabra, while he was despatching one, kept the
other quietly with its head resting on her lap, the knight declared
himself perfectly satisfied, and they set out upon their travels, lovingly
together.</p>

<p>By the luckiest chance, all the wandering knights and their ladies
met at the court of a King of Greece, who is not, certainly, to be
heard of in Gillies’ or Goldsmith’s history. The scenery is now
on a magnificent scale, for there is a regal wedding on foot, and
tournaments, and the real war of Heathenism against all Christendom.
As the Champions of Christendom have as yet done little
to warrant them in assuming the appellation, one would suppose
that the time had now arrived when they were to give the world
a taste of their quality in that respect. But nothing of the sort
occurs. The seven worthies separate, each to his own country, in
order to prepare for great deeds; but none are done for the benefit
of Christianity, unless indeed we are to conclude that when George
and Sabra travelled together, and he overcame all antagonists, and
she inspired with love all beholders;—he subdued nature itself
and she ran continually into danger, from which he rescued her:—and
that when, after being condemned to the stake, the young
wife gave birth to three babes in the wood, and was at last crowned
Queen of Egypt, something is meant by way of allegory, in reference
to old church questions, and in not very clear elucidation as
to how these questions were beneficially affected by the Champions
of Christendom!</p>

<p>I may add that when Sabra was crowned Queen of Egypt, every
one was ordered to be merry, on pain of death! It is further to
be observed there is now much confusion, and that the confusion
by no means grows less as the story thunders on. The Champions
and the three sons of St. George are, by turns, East, West,
North, and South, either pursuing each other, or suddenly and unexpectedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
encountering, like the principal personages in a pantomime.
Battles, love-making, and shutting up cruel and reprobate
magicians from the “humane eye,” are the chief events, but to
every event there are dozens of episodes, and each episode is as
confusing, dazzling, and bewildering as the trunk from which it
hangs.</p>

<p>St. George, however, is like a greater champion than himself;
and when he is idle and in Italy, he does precisely what Nelson
did in the same place—fall in love with a lady, and cause endless
mischief in consequence. By this time, however, Johnson begins
to think, rightly, that his readers have had enough of it, and that
it is time to dispose of his principal characters. These too, are so
well disposed to help him, that when the author kills St. Patrick,
the saint burys himself! In memory of his deeds, of which we
have heard little or nothing, some are accustomed to honor him,
says Mr. Johnson—“wearing upon their hats, each of them, a
cross of red silk, in token of his many adventures under the Christian
Cross.” So that the shamrock appears to have been a device
only of later times.</p>

<p>St. David is as quickly despatched. This champion enters
Wales to crush the pagans there. He wears a leek in his helmet,
and his followers adopt the same fashion, in order that friend may
be distinguished from foe. The doughty saint, of course, comes
conqueror out of the battle, but he is in a heated state, gets a chill
and dies after all of a common cold. Bruce, returning safe from
exploring the Nile, to break his neck by falling down his own
stairs, hardly presents a more practical bathos than this. Why
the leek became the badge of Welshmen need not be further explained.</p>

<p>It is singular that in recounting the manner of the death of the
next champion, St. Denis, the romancer is less romantic than common
tradition. He tells us how the knight repaired to then pagan
France; how he was accused of being a Christian, by another
knight of what we should fancy a Christian order, St. Michael,
and how the pagan king orders St. Denis to be beheaded, in consequence.
There are wonders in the heavens, at this execution,
which convert the heathen sovereign to Christianity; but no mention
is made of St. Denis having walked to a monastery, after his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
head was off, and <i>with</i> his head under his arm. Of this prodigy
Voltaire remarked, “Ce n’est que le premier pas qui coute,” but
of that the romancer makes no mention. St. James suffers by
being shut up in his chapel in Spain, and starved to death, by order
of the Atheist king. Anthony dies quietly in a good old age, in
Italy; St. Andrew is beheaded by the cruel pagan Scots whom,
in his old age, he had visited, in order to bring them to conversion:
and St. George, who goes on, riding down wild monsters and rescuing
timid maidens, to the last—and his inclination, was always
in the direction of the maidens—ultimately meets his death by the
sting of a venomous dragon.</p>

<p>And now it would seem that two or three hundred years ago,
authors were very much like the actors in the <i>Critic</i>, who when they
<i>did</i> get hold of a good thing, could never give the public enough
of it. Accordingly, the biography of the Seven Champions was
followed by that of their sons. I will spare my readers the turbulent
details: they will probably be satisfied with learning that
the three sons of St. George became kings, “according as the
fairy queen had prophesied to them,” and that Sir Turpin, son of
David, Sir Pedro, son of James, Sir Orlando, son of Anthony,
Sir Ewen, son of Andrew, Sir Phelim, son of Patrick, and Sir
Owen, son of David, like their sires, combated with giants, monsters,
and dragons; tilted and tournamented in honor of the ladies,
did battle in defence of Christianity, relieved the distressed, annihilated
necromancers and table-turners, in short, accomplished all
that could be expected from knights of such prowess and chivalry.</p>

<p>When Richard Johnson had reached this part of his history,
he gave it to the world, awaiting the judgment of the critics, before
he published his second portion: that portion wherein he was
to unfold what nobody yet could guess at, namely, wherefore the
Seven Champions were called <i>par excellence</i>, the Champions of
Christendom. I am afraid that meanwhile those terrible, god-like,
and inexorable critics, had not dealt altogether gently with him.
The <i>Punch</i> they offered him was not made exclusively of sweets.
His St. George had been attacked, and very small reverence been
expressed for his ladies. But see how calmly and courteously—all
the more admirable that there must have been some affectation
in the matter—he turns from the censuring judges to that benevolent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
personage, the gentle reader. “Thy courtesy,” he says,
“must be my buckler against the carping malice of mocking jesters,
that being worse able to do well, scoff commonly at that they
can not mend; censuring all things, doing nothing, but (monkey-like)
make apish jests at anything they do in print, and nothing
pleaseth them, except it savor of a scoffing and invective spirit.
Well, what they say of me I do not care; thy delight is my sole
desire.” Well said, bold Richard Johnson. He thought he had
put down criticism as St. George had the dragon.</p>

<p>I can not say, however, that good Richard Johnson treats his
gentle reader fairly. This second part of his Champions is to a
reader worse than what all the labors of Hercules were to the
lusty son of Alcmena. An historical drama at Astley’s is not half
so bewildering, and is almost as credible, and Mr. Ducrow himself
when he was rehearsing his celebrated “spectacle drama” of “St.
George and the Dragon” at old Drury—and who that ever saw
him on those occasions can possibly forget him?—achieved greater
feats, or was more utterly unlike any sane individual than St.
George is, as put upon the literary stage by Master Johnson.</p>

<p>One comfort in tracing the tortuosities of this chivalric romance
is that the action is rapid; but then there is so much of it, and it
is so astounding! We are first introduced to the three sons of
St. George, who are famous hunters in England, and whose mother,
the lady Sabra, “catches her death,” by going out attired like
Diana, to witness their achievements. The chivalric widower
thereupon sets out for Jerusalem, his fellow-champions accompany,
and George’s three sons, Guy, Alexander, and David, upon insinuation
from their mother’s spirit, start too in pursuit. The lads
were knighted by the king of England before they commenced
their journey, which they perform with the golden spur of chivalry
attached to their heels. They meet with the usual adventures by
the way: destroying giants, and rescuing virgins, who in these
troublesome times seem to have been allowed to travel about too
much by themselves. Meanwhile, their sire is enacting greater
prodigies still, and is continually delivering his fellow-champions
from difficulties, from which they are unable to extricate themselves.
Indeed, in all circumstances, his figure is the most prominent; and
although the other half-dozen <i>must</i> have rendered some service on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
each occasion, St. George makes no more mention of the same
than Marshal St. Arnaud, in his letters on the victory at the Alma,
does of the presence and services of the English.</p>

<p>It is said that Mrs. Radcliffe, whose horrors used to delight and
distress our mothers and aunts, in their younger days, became herself
affected by the terrors which she only paints to explain away
natural circumstances. What then must have been the end of
Richard Johnson? His scene of the enchantments of the Black
Castle is quite enough to have killed the author with bewilderment.
There is a flooring in the old palace of the Prince of Orange in
Brussels, which is so inlaid with small pieces of wood, of a thousand
varieties of patterns, as to be a triumph of its kind. I was
not at all surprised, when standing on that floor, to hear that when
the artist had completed his inconceivable labor, he gave one wild
gaze over the <i>parquet</i> of the palace, and dropped dead of a fit of
giddiness. I am sure that Richard Johnson must have met with
some such calamity after revising this portion of his history. It
is a portion in which it is impossible for the Champions or for the
readers to go to sleep. The noise is terrific, the incidents fall like
thunderbolts, the changes roll over each other in a succession made
with electric rapidity, and when the end comes we are all the more
rejoiced, because we have comprehended nothing; but we are especially
glad to find that the knight of the Black Castle, who is
the cause of all the mischief, is overcome, flies in a state of destitution
to a neighboring wood, and being irretrievably “hard up,”
stabs himself with the first thing at hand, as ruthlessly as the lover
of the “Ratcatcher’s Daughter.”</p>

<p>Time, place, propriety, and a respect for contemporary history,
are amusingly violated throughout the veracious details. Nothing
can equal the confusion, nothing can be more absurd than the
errors. But great men have committed errors as grave. Shakespeare
opened a seaport in Bohemia, and Mr. Macaulay wrote
of one Penn what was only to be attributed to another. And now,
have the dramatists treated St. George better than the romancers?</p>

<p>The national saint was, doubtless, often introduced in the Mysteries;
but the first occasion of which I have any knowledge of
his having been introduced on the stage, was by an author named
John Kirke. John was so satisfied with his attempt that he never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
wrote a second play. He allowed his fame to rest on the one in
question, which is thus described on his title-page: “The Seven
Champions of Christendome. Acted at the <i>Cocke Pit</i>, and at the
<i>Red Bull</i> in St. John’s Streete, with a general liking, And never
printed till this <i>yeare</i> 1638. Written by J. K.—London, printed
by J. Okes, and are (<i>sic</i>) to be sold by James Becket, at his Shop
in the Inner Temple Gate, 1638.”</p>

<p>John Kirke treats his subject melodramatically. In the first
scene, Calib the Witch, in a speech prefacing her declarations of a
love for foul weather and deeds, tells the audience by way of prologue,
how she had stolen the young St. George from his now defunct
parent, with the intention of making a bath for her old bones
out of his young warm blood. Love, however, had touched her,
and she had brought up “the red-lipped boy,” with some indefinite
idea of making something of him when a man.</p>

<p>With this disposition the old lady has some fears as to the possible
approaching term of her life; but, as she is assured by “Tarfax
the Devill” that she can not die unless she love blindly, the
witch, like a mere mortal, accounting that she loves wisely, reckons
herself a daughter of immortality, and rejoices hugely. The colloquy
of this couple is interrupted by their son Suckabud, who,
out of a head just broken by St. George, makes complaint with
that comic lack of fun, which was wont to make roar the entire
inside of the Red Bull. The young clown retires with his sire,
and then enters the great St. George, a lusty lad, with a world of
inquiries touching his parentage. Calib explains that his lady
mother was anything but an honest woman, and that his sire was
just the partner to match. “Base or noble, pray?” asks St.
George. To which the witch replies:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Base and noble too;</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Both base by thee, but noble by descent;</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And thou born base, yet mayst thou write true gent:”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and it may be said, parenthetically, that many a “true gent” is by
birth equal to St. George himself.</p>

<p>Overcome by her affection, the witch makes a present to St.
George of the half-dozen champions of England whom she holds
in chains within her dwelling. One of them is described as “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
lively, brisk, cross-cap’ring Frenchman, Denis.” With these for
slaves, Calib yields her wand of power, and the giver is no sooner
out of sight when George invokes the shades of his parents, who
not only appear and furnish him with a corrected edition of his
biography, but inform him that he is legitimate Earl of Coventry,
with all the appurtenances that a young earl can desire.</p>

<p>Thereupon ensues a hubbub that must have shaken all the lamps
in the cockpit. George turns the Witch’s power against herself,
and she descends to the infernal regions, where she is punningly
declared to have gained the title of Duchess of Helvetia. The
six champions are released, and the illustrious seven companions
go forth in search of adventures, with Suckabus for a “Squire.”
The father of the latter gives him some counsel at parting, which
is a parody on the advice of Polonius to Laertes. “Lie,” says
Torpax:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Lie to great profit, borrow, pay no debts,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Cheat and purloin, they are gaming dicers’ bets.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“If Cottington outdo me,” says the son, “he be-whipt.” And
so, after the election of St. George as the seventh champion of
Christendom, ends one of the longest acts that Bull or Cockpit
was ever asked to witness and applaud.</p>

<p>The next act is briefer but far more bustling. We are in that
convenient empire of Trebizond, where everything happened which
never took place, according to the romances. The whole city is
in a state of consternation at the devastations of a detestable
dragon, and a lion, his friend and co-partner. The nobles bewail
the fact in hexameters, or at least in lines meant to do duty for
them; and the common people bewail the fact epigrammatically,
and describe the deaths of all who have attempted to slay the
monsters, with a broadness of effect that doubtless was acknowledged
by roars of laughter. Things grow worse daily, the fiends
look down, and general gloom is settling thick upon the empire,
when Andrew of Scotland and Anthony of Italy arrive, send in
their cards, and announce their determination to slay both these
monsters.</p>

<p>Such visitors are received with more than ordinary welcome.
The emperor is regardless of expense in his liberality, and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
daughter Violetta whispers to her maid Carinthia that she is
already in love with one of them, but will not say which; a remark
which is answered by the pert maid, that she is in love with both,
and would willingly take either. All goes on joyously until in
the course of conversation, and it is by no means remarkable for
brilliancy, the two knights let fall that they are Christians. Now,
you must know, that the established Church at Trebizond at this
time, which is at any period, was heathen. The court appeared
to principally affect Apollo and Diana, while the poorer people
put up with Pan, and abused him for denouncing may-poles!
Well, the Christians had never been emancipated; nay, they had
never been tolerated in Trebizond, and it was contrary to law that
the country should be saved, even in its dire extremity, by Christian
help. The knights are doomed to die, unless they will turn
heathens. This, of course, they decline with a dignified scorn;
whereupon, in consideration of their nobility, they are permitted
to choose their own executioners. They make choice of the ladies,
but Violetta and Carinthia protest that they can not think of such
a thing. Their high-church sire is disgusted with their want of
orthodoxy, and he finally yields to the knights their swords, that
they may do justice on themselves as the law requires. But
Andrew and Anthony are no sooner armed again than they clear
their way to liberty, and the drop scene falls upon the rout of the
whole empire of Trebizond.</p>

<p>The third act is of gigantic length, and deals with giants. There
is mourning in Tartary. David has killed the king’s son in a tournament,
and the king remarks, like a retired apothecary, that
“Time’s plaster must draw the sore before he can feel peace
again.” To punish David, he is compelled to undertake the destruction
of the enchanter Ormandine, who lived in a cavern fortress
with “some selected friends.” The prize of success is the reversion
of the kingdom of Tartary to the Welsh knight. The latter goes
upon his mission, but he is so long about it that our old friend Chorus
enters, to explain what he affirms they have not time to act—namely,
the great deeds of St. George, who, as we learn, had slain
the never-to-be-forgotten dragon, rescued Sabrina, been cheated of
his reward, and held in prison seven years upon bread and water.
His squire, Suckabus, alludes to giants whom he and his master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
had previously slain, and whose graves were as large as Tothill
Fields. He also notices “Ploydon’s law,” and other matters, that
could hardly have been contemporaneous with the palmy days of
the kingdom of Tartary. Meanwhile, David boldly assaults
Ormandine, but the enchanter surrounds him with some delicious-looking
nymphs, all thinly clad and excessively seductive; and we
are sorry to say that the Welsh champion, not being cavalierly
mounted on proper principles, yields to seduction, and after various
falls under various temptations, is carried to bed by the rollicking
nymph Drunkenness.</p>

<p>But never did good, though fallen, men want for a friend at a
pinch. St. George is in the neighborhood; and seedy as he is
after seven years in the dark, with nothing more substantial by
way of food than bread, and nothing more exhilarating for beverage
than <i>aqua pura</i>, the champion of England does David’s work,
and with more generosity than justice, makes him a present of the
enchanter’s head. David presents the same to the King of Tartary,
that, according to promise pledged in case of such a present
being made, he may be proclaimed heir-apparent to the Tartarian
throne. With this bit of cheating, the long third act comes to an
end.</p>

<p>The fourth act is taken up with an only partially successful attack
by James, David, and Patrick, on a cruel enchanter, Argalio,
who at least is put to flight, and <i>that</i>, at all events, as the knights
remark, is something to be thankful for. The fifth and grand act
reveals to us the powerful magician, Brandron, in his castle. He
holds in thrall the King of Macedon—a little circumstance not
noted in history; and he has in his possession the seven daughters
of his majesty transformed into swans. The swans contrive to
make captives of six of the knights as they were taking a “gentle
walk” upon his ramparts. They are impounded as trespassers,
and Brandron, who has some low comedy business with Suckubus,
will not release them but upon condition that they fight honestly
in his defence against St. George. The six duels take place, and
of course the champion of England overcomes all his friendly antagonists;
whereupon Brandron, with his club, beats out his own
brains, in presence of the audience.</p>

<p>At this crisis, the King of Macedon appears, restored to power,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
and inquires after his daughters. St. George and the rest, with
a use of the double negatives that would have shocked Lindley
Murray, declare</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“We never knew, nor saw no ladies here.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The swans, however, soon take their pristine form, and the three
daughters appear fresh from their plumes and their long bath upon
the lake. Upon this follows the smart dialogue which we extract
as a sample of how sharply the King of Macedon looked to his
family interests, and how these champion knights were “taken in”
before they well knew how the fact was accomplished.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Mac.</i> Reverend knights, may we desire to know which of you are</div>
<div class="verse indent0">unmarried?</div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Ant., Den., and Pat.</i> We are.</div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Geo.</i> Then here’s these ladies, take ’em to your beds.</div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Mac.</i> George highly honors aged Macedon.</div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>The three Knights.</i> But can the ladies’ love accord with us?</div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>The three Ladies.</i> Most willingly!</div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>The three Knights.</i> We thus then seal our contract.</div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Geo.</i> Which thus we ratifie.</div>
<div class="verse indent11">Sit with the brides, most noble Macedon;</div>
<div class="verse indent11">And since kind fortune sent such happy chance,</div>
<div class="verse indent11">We’ll grace your nuptials with a soldier’s dance.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And, fore George, as our fathers used to say, they make a night
of it. The piece ends with a double military reel, and the audiences
at the Bull and the Cockpit probably whistled the tune as they
wended their way homeward to crab-apple ale and spiced gingerbread.</p>

<p>Next to the Champions of Christendom, the King’s Knight
Champion of England is perhaps the most important personage—in
the point of view of chivalry. I think it is some French author
who has said, that revolutions resemble the game of chess, where
the pawns or pieces (<i>les pions</i>) may cause the ruin of the king,
save him, or take his place. Now the <i>champ pion</i>, as this French
remark reminds me, is nothing more than the field <i>pion</i>, pawn, or
piece, put forward to fight in the king’s quarrel.</p>

<p>The family of the Champion of England bears, it may be observed,
exactly the name which suits a calling so derived. The
appellation “Dymoke” is derived from <i>De Umbrosâ Quercu</i>; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
should rather say it is the translation of it; and Harry De Umbrosâ
Quercu is only Harry of the Shady or Dim Oak, a very apt
dwelling-place and name for one whose chief profession was that
of field-pawn to the king.</p>

<p>This derivation or adaptation of names from original Latin surnames
is common enough, and some amusing pages might be written
on the matter, in addition to what has been so cleverly put
together by Mr. Mark Anthony Lower, in his volume devoted
especially to an elucidation of English surnames.</p>

<p>The royal champions came in with the Conquest. The Norman
dukes had theirs in the family of Marmion—ancestors of that
Marmion of Sir Walter Scott’s, who commits forgery, like a common
knave of more degenerate times. The Conqueror conferred
sundry broad lands in England on his champions; among others,
the lands adjacent to, as well as the castle of Tamworth. Near
this place was the first nunnery established in this country. The
occupants were the nuns of St. Edith, at Polesworth. Robert de
Marmion used the ladies very “cavalierly,” ejected them from their
house, and deprived them of their property. But such victims
had a wonderfully clever way of recovering their own.</p>

<p>My readers may possibly remember how a certain Eastern potentate
injured the church, disgusted the Christians generally, and
irritated especially that Simeon Stylites who sat on the summit of
a pillar, night and day, and never moved from his abiding-place.
The offender had a vision, in which he not only saw the indignant
Simeon, but was cudgelled almost into pulp by the <i>simulacre</i> of
that saint. I very much doubt if Simeon himself was in his airy
dwelling-place at that particular hour of the night. I was reminded
of this by what happened to the duke’s champion, Robert de
Marmion. He was roused from a deep sleep by the vision of a
stout lady, who announced herself as the wronged St. Edith, and
who proceeded to show her opinion of De Marmion’s conduct
toward her nuns, by pommelling his ribs with her crosier, until
she had covered his side with bruises, and himself with repentance.
What strong-armed young monk played St. Edith that
night, it is impossible to say; but that he enacted the part successfully,
is seen from the fact that Robert brought back the ladies to
Polesworth, and made ample restitution of all of which they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
been deprived. The nuns, in return, engaged with alacrity to inter
all defunct Marmions within the chapter-house of their abbey, for
nothing.</p>

<p>With the manor of Tamworth in Warwickshire, Marmion held
that of Scrivelsby in Lincolnshire. The latter was held of the
King by grand sergeantry, “to perform the office of champion at
the King’s coronation.” At his death he was succeeded by a son
of the same Christian name, who served the monks of Chester precisely
as his sire had treated the nuns at Polesworth. This second
Robert fortified his ill-acquired prize—the priory; but happening
to fall into one of the newly-made ditches, when inspecting the fortifications,
a soldier of the Earl of Chester killed him, without difficulty,
as he lay with broken hip and thigh, at the bottom of the
fosse. The next successor, a third Robert, was something of a
judge, with a dash of the warrior, too, and he divided his estates
between two sons, both Roberts, by different mothers. The eldest
son and chief possessor, after a bustling and emphatically “battling”
life, was succeeded by his son Philip, who fell into some
trouble in the reign of Henry III. for presuming to act as a judge
or justice of the peace, without being duly commissioned. This
Philip was, nevertheless, one of the most faithful servants to a
king who found so many faithless; and if honors were heaped
upon him in consequence, he fairly merited them all. He was
happy, too, in marriage, for he espoused a lady sole heiress to a
large estate, and who brought him four daughters, co-heiresses to
the paternal and maternal lands of the Marmions and the Kilpecs.</p>

<p>This, however, is wandering. Let us once more return to orderly
illustration. In St. George I have shown how pure romance
deals with a hero. In the next chapter I will endeavor to show
in what spirit the lives and actions of real English heroes have
been treated by native historians. In so doing, I will recount the
story of Sir Guy of Warwick, after their fashion, with original illustrations
and “modern instances.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c9">SIR GUY OF WARWICK,</h2>
</div>

<p class="c sp less">AND WHAT BEFELL HIM.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse indent0">Are higher than his state, and his deserts</div>

<div class="verse indent12"><i>Chapman’s Byron’s Conspiracy.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> Christian name of Guy was once an exceedingly popular
name in the county of York. I have never heard a reason assigned
for this, but I think it may have originated in admiration
of the deeds and the man whose appellation and reputation have
survived to our times. I do not allude to Guy Faux; <i>that</i> young
gentleman was the Father of Perverts, but by no means the first
of the Guys.</p>

<p>The “Master Guy” of whom I am treating here, or, rather,
about to treat, was a youth whose family originally came from
Northumberland. That family was, in one sense, more noble than
the imperial family of Muscovy, for its members boasted not only
of good principles, but of sound teeth.</p>

<p>The teeth and principles of the Romanoffs are known to be in a
distressing state of dilapidation.</p>

<p>Well; these Northumbrian Guys having lived extremely fast,
and being compelled to compound with their creditors, by plundering
the latter, and paying them zero in the pound, migrated southward,
and finally settled in Warwickshire. Now, the head of the
house had a considerable share of common sense about him, and
after much suffering in a state of shabby gentility, he not only sent
his daughters out to earn their own livelihood, but, to the intense
disgust of his spouse, hired himself as steward to that noble gentleman
the Earl of Warwick. “My blood is as good as ever it was,”
said he to the fine lady his wife. “It is the blood of an upper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
servant,” cried she, “and my father’s daughter is the spouse of a
flunkey.”</p>

<p>The husband was not discouraged; and he not only opened his
office in his patron’s castle but he took his only son with him, and
made him his first clerk. This son’s name was Guy; and he was
rather given to bird-catching, hare-snaring, and “gentism” generally.
He had been a precocious youth from some months previous
to his birth, and had given his lady-mother such horrid annoyance,
that she was always dreaming of battles, fiery-cars, strong-smelling
dragons, and the wrathful Mars. “Well,” she used to remark to
her female friends, while the gentlemen were over their wine, “I
expect that this boy” (she had made up her mind to that) “will
make a noise in the world, draw bills upon his father, and be the
terror of maid-servants. Why, do you know——” and here she
became confidential, and I do not feel authorized to repeat what
she then communicated.</p>

<p>But Master Guy, the “little stranger” alluded to, proved better
than was expected. He might have been considerably worse, and
yet would not have been so bad as maternal prophecy had depicted
him. At eight years ... but I hear you say, “When
did all this occur?” Well, it was in a November’s “Morning
Post,” that announcement was made of the birth; and as to the
year, Master Guy has given it himself in the old metrical
romance,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Two hundred and twenty years and odd,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">After our Savior Christ his birth,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">When King Athelstan wore the crown,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">I livéd here upon the earth.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At eight years old, I was about to remark, young Guy was the
most insufferable puppy of his district. He won all the prizes
for athletic sports; and by the time he was sixteen there was not
a man in all England who dared accept his challenge to wrestle
with both arms, against <i>him</i> using only one.</p>

<p>It was at this time that he kept his father’s books and a leash
of hounds, with the latter of which he performed such extraordinary
feats, that the Earl of Warwick invited him from the steward’s
room to his own table; where Guy’s father changed his plate,
and Master Guy twitched him by the beard as he did it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>At the head of the earl’s table sat his daughter “Phillis the
Fair,” a lady who, like her namesake in the song, was “sometimes
forward, sometimes coy,” and altogether so sweetly smiling and so
beguiling, that when the earl asked Guy if he would not come and
hunt (the dinner was at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>), Guy answered, as the Frenchman
did who could not bear the sport, with a <i>Merci, j’ai été!</i> and
affecting an iliac seizure, hinted at the necessity of staying at home.</p>

<p>The youth forthwith was carried to bed. Phillis sent him a
posset, the earl sent him his own physician; and this learned gentleman,
after much perplexity veiled beneath the most affable and
confident humbug, wrote a prescription which, if it could do the
patient no good would do him no harm. He was a most skilful
man, and his patients almost invariably recovered under this treatment.
He occasionally sacrificed one or two when a consultation
was held, and he was called upon to prescribe <i>secundum artem</i>;
but he compensated for this professional slaying by, in other cases,
leaving matters to Nature, who was the active partner in his firm,
and of whose success he was not in the least degree jealous. So,
when he had written the prescription, Master Guy fell a discoursing
of the passion of love, and <i>that</i> with a completeness and a
variety of illustration as though he were the author of the chapter
on that subject in Burton’s “Anatomy of Melancholy.” The
doctor heard him to the end, gently rubbing one side of his nose
the while with the index-finger of his right hand; and when his
patient had concluded, the medical gentleman smiled, hummed
“Phillis is my only joy,” and left the room with his head nodding
like a Chinese Mandarin’s.</p>

<p>By this time the four o’clock sun was making green and gold
pillars of the trees in the neighboring wood, and Guy got up,
looked at the falling leaves, and thought of the autumn of his hopes.
He whistled “Down, derry, down,” with a marked emphasis on
the <i>down</i>; but suddenly his hopes again sprang up, as he beheld
Phillis among her flower-beds, engaged in the healthful occupation
which a sublime poet has given to the heroine whom he names,
and whose action he describes, when he tells us that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Miss Dinah was a-walking in her garding one day.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Guy trussed his points, pulled up his hose, set his bonnet smartly
on his head, clapped a bodkin on his thigh, and then walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
into the garden with the air of the once young D’Egville in a
ballet, looking after a nymph—which indeed was a pursuit he was
much given to when he was <i>old</i> D’Egville, and could no longer
bound through his ballets, because he was stiff in the joints.</p>

<p>Guy, of course, went down on one knee, and at once plunged
into the most fiery style of declaration, but Phillis had not read
the Mrs. Chapone of that day for nothing. She brought him
back to prose and propriety, and then the two started afresh, and
they <i>did</i> talk! Guy felt a little “streaked” at first, but he soon
recovered his self-possession, and it would have been edifying for
the young mind to have heard how these two pretty things spoke
to, and answered each other in moral maxims stolen from the top
pages of their copy-books. They poured them out by the score,
and the proverbial philosophy they enunciated was really the origin
of the book so named by Martin Tupper. He took it all from
Phillis and Guy, whose descendants, of the last name, were so
famous for their school-books. This I expect Mr. Tupper will
(not) mention in his next edition.</p>

<p>After much profitable interchange of this sort of article, the
lady gently hinted that Master Guy was not indifferent to her, but
that he was of inferior birth, yet of qualities that made him equal
with her; adding, that hitherto he had done little but kill other
people’s game, whereas there were nobler deeds to be accomplished.
And then she bade him go in search of perilous adventures,
winding up with the toast and sentiment, “Master Guy,
eagles do not care to catch flies.”</p>

<p>Reader, if you have ever seen the prince of pantomimists, Mr.
Payne, tear the hair of his theatrical wig in a fit of amorous despair,
you may have some idea as to the intensity with which
Master Guy illustrated his own desperation. He stamped the
ground with such energy that all the hitherto quiet aspens fell
a-shaking, and their descendants have ever since maintained the
same fashion. Phillis fell a-crying at this demonstration, and
softened considerably. After a lapse of five minutes, she had
blushingly directed Master Guy to “speak to papa.”</p>

<p>Now, of all horrible interviews, this perhaps is the most horrible.
Nelson used to say that there was only one thing on earth which
he dreaded, and that was dining with a mayor and corporation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
Doubtless it is dreadful, but <i>what</i> is it compared with looking a
grave man in the face, who has no sentiment into him, and whose
first remark is sure to be, “Well, sir, be good enough to tell me—what
can you settle on my daughter? What can you do to secure
her happiness?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Guy, in reply to this stereotyped remark, “I can
kill the Dun cow on the heath. <i>She</i> has killed many herself
who’ve tried the trick on her; and last night she devoured crops
of clover, and twice as many fields of barley on your lordship’s
estate.”</p>

<p>“First kill the cow, and then——,” said the earl with a smile;
and Shakespeare had the echo of this speech in his ear, when he
began the fifth act of his Othello. Now Guy was not easily
daunted. If I cared to make a pun, I might easily have said
“cowed,” but in a grave and edifying narrative this loose method
of writing would be extremely improper. Guy, then, was not
a coward—nay, nothing is hidden under the epithet. He tossed
a little in bed that night as he thought the matter over, and
the next morning made sheets of paper as crumpled as the cow’s
horns, as he rejected the plans of assault he had designed upon
them, and sat uncertain as to what he should do in behoof of his
own fortune. He at length determined to go and visit the terrible
animal “incognito.” It is the very word used by one of the
biographers of Guy, an anonymous Northumbrian, who published
the life on a broad sheet, with a picture of Master Guy which
might have frightened the cow, and which is infinitely more ugly.
Neither the black-letter poem, the old play, nor the pamphlets or
ballads, use the term <i>incognito</i>, but all declare that Guy proceeded
with much caution, and a steel cuirass over his jerkin. I mention
these things, because without correctness my narrative would be
worthless. I am not imaginative, and would not embroider a plain
suit of fact upon any account.</p>

<p>Guy’s carefulness is to be proved. Here was a cow that had
been more destructive than ever Red Riding Hood’s Wolf was—that
Count Wolf, who used to snap up young maidens, and lived
as careless of respectability as was to be expected of a man once
attached to a “marching regiment,” and who turned monk. The
cow was twelve feet high, from the hoof to the shoulder, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
eighteen feet long, from the neck to the root of the tail. All the
dragons ever heard of had never been guilty of such devastation to
life and property as this terrible cow. Guy looked at her and did
not like her. The cow detected him and rushed at her prey. Guy
was active, attacked her in front and rear, as the allies did the forts
of Bomarsund; very considerably confused her by burying his
battle-axe in her skull; hung on by her tail as she attempted to
fly; and finally gave her the <i>coup de grace</i> by passing his rapier
rapidly and repeatedly through her especially vulnerable point
behind the ear. In proof of the fact, the scene of the conflict still
bears the name of Dunsmore Heath, and that is a wider basis of
proof than many “facts” stand upon, to which we are required by
plodding teachers to give assent.</p>

<p>Besides, there is a rib of this very cow exhibited at Bristol.
To be sure it is not a rib now of a cow, but out of reverence to
the antiquity of the assertion which allegedly makes it so, I think
we are bound to believe what is thus advanced. Not that I do
myself, but that is of no consequence. I have a strong idea that
the cow was not a cow, but a countess (not a Countess Cowper),
who made war in her own right, lived a disreputable life, was as
destructive to wealthy young lords as a <i>Lorette</i>, and won whole
estates by cheating at <i>écarté</i>. Guy took a hand, and beat her.</p>

<p>Poor Master Guy, he was as hardly used as ever Jacob was,
and much he meditated thereupon in the fields at eventide. The
stern earl would by no means give his consent to the marriage of
his daughter with the young champion, until the latter had performed
some doughtier deeds than this. The boy (he was still in
his teens) took heart of grace, divided a crooked sixpence with
Phillis, and straightway sailed for Normandy, where he arrived,
after meeting as many thieves by the way as if he had walked
about for a month in the streets of Dover. But Master Guy killed
all <i>he</i> met; there is a foolish judicial, not to say social, prejudice
against our doing the same with the bandits of Dover. I can not
conjecture why; perhaps they have a privilege under some of the
city companies, whereby they are constituted the legal skinners
of all sojourners among them, carrying filthy lucre.</p>

<p>Guy met in Normandy with the last person he could have expected
to fall in with—no other than the Emperor of Almayne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
a marvellously ubiquitous person to be met with in legends, and
frequently encountered in the seaports of inland towns. The
historians are here a little at issue. One says that Master Guy
having found a certain Dorinda tied to the stake, and awaiting a
champion who would stake his own life for her rescue, inquired
the “antecedents” of the position. Dorinda, it appears, had been
as rudely used as young lady possibly could be, “by the Duke
of Blois, his son,” and the duke was so enraged at Dorinda’s charge
against his favorite Otto, that he condemned her to be burned
alive, unless a champion appeared in time to rescue her by defeating
the aforesaid Otto in single combat. Guy, of course, transacted
the little business successfully; spoiled Otto’s beauty by slashing
his nose; and so enchanted Dorinda, that she never accused her
champion of doing aught displeasing to her.</p>

<p>Anxious as I am touching the veracity of this narrative, I have
recorded what biographers state, though not in their own words.
But I must add, that in some of the histories this episode about
Dorinda is altogether omitted, and we only hear of Master Guy
appearing in panoply at a tournament given by the Emperor of
Allemagne, in Normandy—which is much the same, gentle reader,
as if I were, at your cost, to give a concert and ball, with a supper
from Farrance’s, and all, not in my house, but in yours. Nevertheless,
in Normandy the tournament was held, and the paternal
Emperor of Allemagne, having then a daughter, Blanche, of whom
he wished to get rid, he set her up as the prize of the conquering
knight in the tournament.</p>

<p>I think I hear you remark something as to the heathenness of
the custom. But it is a custom sacred to these times; and our
neighbors (for of course neither you nor I could condescend to
such manners) get up evening tournaments of whist, quadrilles,
and a variety of singing—of every variety but the good and intelligible,
and at these modern tournaments given for the express
purpose which that respectable old gentleman, the Emperor of
Allemagne, had in view when he opened his lists; the “girls” are
the prizes of the carpet-knights. So gentlemen, <i>faites votre jeu</i>,
as the philosopher who presided at Frescati’s used to say—<i>faites
votre jeu, Messieurs</i>; and go in and win. Perhaps if you read
Cowper, you may be the better armed against loss in such a conflict.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>I need not say that Master Guy’s good sword, which gleamed
like lightning in the arena, and rained blows faster than ever Mr.
Blanchard rained them, in terrific Coburg combats, upon the vulnerable
crest of Mr. Bradley—won for him the peerless prize—to
say nothing of a dog and a falcon thrown in. Master Guy
rather ungallantly declined having the lady, though her father
would have given him <i>carte blanche</i>; he looked at her, muttered
her name, and then murmured, “Blanche, as thou art, yet art
thou black-a-moor, compared with my Phillis;”—and with this
unchivalric avowal, for it was a part of chivalry to say a thing
and think another, he returned to England, carrying with him the
“Spaniel King’s Charls,” as French authors write it, and the
falcon, with a ring and a perch, like a huge parroquet.</p>

<p>Master Guy entered Warwick in a “brougham,” as we now
might say, and sorely was he put to it with the uneasy bird. At
every lurch of the vehicle, out flapped the wings, elongated was
the neck, and Master Guy had to play at “dodge” with the falcon,
who was intent upon darting his terrific beak into the cavalier’s
nose. At length, however, the castle was safely reached; the
presents were deposited at the feet of Phillis the Fair, and Guy
hoped, like the Peri, and also like that gentle spirit to be disappointed,
that the gates of paradise were about to open. But not
so, Phillis warmly praised his little regard for that pert minx,
Blanche, or <i>Blanc d’Espagne</i>, as she wickedly added; and she
patted the spaniel, and offered sugar to the falcon; and, after the
dinner to which Guy <i>was</i> invited, she intimated in whispers, that
they were both “too young as yet” (not that she believed so), and
that more deeds must be done by Guy, ere the lawyers would be
summoned by her papa to achieve some of their own.</p>

<p>The youthful Guy went forth “reluctant but resolved,” and he
<i>would</i> have sung as he went along,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Elle a quinze ans, moi j’en ai seize,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>of Sedaine and Grétry, only neither poet nor composer, nor the
opera of <i>Richard Cœur de Lion</i>, had yet appeared to gladden
heart and ear. But the sentiment was there, and perhaps Sedaine
knew of it when he penned the words. However this may be,
Master Guy, though soft of heart, was not so of arm, for on this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
present cause of errantry he enacted such deeds that their very
enumeration makes one breathless. His single sword cleared
whole forests of hordes of brigands, through whose sides his
trenchant blade passed as easily as the sabre, when held by Corporal
Sutton, through a dead sheep. Our hero was by no means
particular as to what he did, provided he was doing something;
nor what cause he fought for, provided there were a cause and a
fight. Thus we find him aiding the Duke of Louvain against his
old friend the Emperor of Allemagne. He led the Duke’s forces,
slew thousands upon thousands of the enemy, and, as though he
had the luck of a modern Muscovite army, did not lose more than
“one man,” with slight damage to the helmet of a second.</p>

<p>Master Guy, not yet twenty, surpassed the man whom Mr.
Thiers calls “<i>ce pur Anglais</i>,” Mr. Pitt, for he became a prime
minister ere he had attained his majority. In that capacity he
negotiated a peace for the Duke with the Emperor. The two
potentates were so satisfied with the negotiator, that out of compliment
they offered him the command of their united fleet against
the Pagan Soldan of Byzantium. They did not at all expect that
he would accept it; but then they were not aware that Master Guy
had much of the spirit which Sidney Smith, in after-years, discerned
in Lord John Russell—and the enterprising Guy accepted
the command of the entire fleet, with quite an entire confidence.</p>

<p>He did therewith, if chroniclers are to be credited, more than
we might reasonably expect from Lord John Russell, were that
statesman to be in command of a Channel squadron. Having
swept the sea, he rather prematurely, if dates are to be respected,
nearly annihilated Mohammedanism—and he was as invincible and
victorious against every kind of Pagan. It was in the East that
he overthrew in single combat, the giants Colbron and his brother
Mongadora. He was resting after this contest, and leaning like
the well-breathed Hotspur, upon his sword, at the entrance to his
tent, when the Turkish governor Esdalante, approaching him, politely
begged that he might take his head, as he had promised the
same to an Osmanlee lady, who was in a condition of health which
might be imperilled by refusal. Master Guy as politely bade him
take it if he could, and therewith, they went at it “like French
falconers,” and Guy took off the head of his opponent instead of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
losing his own. This little matter being settled, Guy challenged
the infidel Soldan himself, putting Christianity against Islamism,
on the issue, and thus professing to decide questions of faith as
Galerius did when he left Olympus and Calvary to depend upon
a vote of the Roman senate. Master Guy, being thrice armed by
the justness of his quarrel, subdued the infidel Soldan, but the latter,
to show, as we are told, his insuperable hatred for Christianity,
took handfuls of his own blood, and cast it in the face of his
conqueror—and no doubt here, the victor had in his mind the true
story of Julian insulting “the Galilæan.” We thus see how history
is made to contribute to legend.</p>

<p>And now the appetite of the errant lover grew by what it fed
upon. He mixed himself up in every quarrel, and could not see
a lion and a dragon quietly settling their disputes in a wood, by
dint of claws, without striking in for the lion, slaying his foe, and
receiving with complacency the acknowledgments of the nobler beast.</p>

<p>He achieved something more useful when he met Lord Terry
in a wood, looking for his wife who had been carried off by a
score of ravishers. While the noble lord sat down on a mossy
bank, like a gentleman in a melodrama, Guy rescued his wife in
his presence, and slew all the ravishers, “in funeral order,” the
youngest first. He subsequently stood godfather to his friend
Terry’s child, and as I am fond of historical parallels, I may notice
that Sir Walter Scott performed the same office for a Terry, who
if he was not a lord, often represented them, to say nothing of
monarchs and other characters.</p>

<p>Master Guy’s return to England was a little retarded by another
characteristic adventure. As he was passing through Louvain,
he found Duke Otto besieging his father in his own castle—“governor”
of the castle and the Duke. Now nothing shocked
Master Guy so much as filial ingratitude, and despite all that Otto
could urge about niggardly allowance, losses at play, debts of
honor, and the parsimony of the “governor,” our champion made
common cause with the “indignant parent,” and not only mortally
wounded Otto, but, before the latter died, Guy brought him to a
“sense of his situation,” and Otto died in a happy frame of mind,
leaving all his debts to his father. The legacy was by way of a
“souvenir,” and certainly the governor never forgot it. As for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
Guy, he killed the famous boar of Louvain, before he departed for
England, and as he drew his sword from the animal’s flank, he
remarked, there lies a greater boar, and not a less beast than Otto
himself. However, he took the head and hams with him, for
Phillis was fond of both; and as she was wont to say, if there
was anything that could seduce her, it was brawn!</p>

<p>When Master Guy stepped ashore at Harwich, where that amphibious
town now lies soaking, deputations from all quarters were
awaiting him, to ask his succor against some terrible dragon in the
north that was laying waste all the land, and laying hold of all the
waists which the men there wished to enclose. King Athelstan
was then at York hoping to terrify the indomitable beast by power
of an army, which in combat with the noxious creature made as
long a tail, in retreat, as the dragon itself.</p>

<p>Now whatever this nuisance was which so terribly plagued the
good folks in the North, whether a dragon with a tongue thirty
feet long, or anything else equally hard to imagine, it is matter
of fact that our Master Guy assuredly got the better of it. On
his return he met an ovation in York; Athelstan entertained him
at a banquet, covered him with honor, endowed him with a good
round sum, and <i>thus</i> all the newborn male children in the county
became Guys. At least two thirds of them received the popular
name, and for many centuries it remained in favor, until disgrace
was brought upon it by the York proctor’s son, whose effigy still
glides through our streets on each recurring 5th of November.</p>

<p>I will not pause on this matter. I will only add that the Earl
of Warwick, finding Guy a man whom the King delighted to honor,
accepted him for a son-in-law; and then, ever wise, and civil, and
proper, he discreetly died. The King made Guy Earl of Warwick,
in his place, and our hero being now a married man, he of
course ceased to be <i>Master</i> Guy.</p>

<p>And here I might end my legend, but that it has a moral in it
Guy did a foolish but a common thing, he launched out into extravagant
expenses, and, suddenly, he found himself sick, sad, and
insolvent. Whether, therewith, his wife was soured, creditors
troublesome, and bailiffs presuming, it is hard to say. One thing,
however, is certain, that to save himself from all three, Earl Guy
did what nobles often do now, in the same predicament, “went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
abroad.” Guy, however, travelled in primitive style. He went
on foot, and made his inn o’nights in church-yards, where he colloquized
with the skulls after the fashion of Hamlet with the skull
of “poor Yorick.” He had given out that he was going to Jerusalem,
but hearing that the Danes were besieging Athelstan at
Winchester, he went thither, and, in modest disguise, routed them
with his own unaided hand. Among his opponents, he met with
the giant Colbron whom he had previously slain in Orient lands,
and the two fought their battles o’er again, and with such exactly
similar results as to remind one of the peculiar philosophy of Mr.
Boatswain Cheeks.</p>

<p>This appearance of Colbron in two places is a fine illustration
of the “myth,” and I mention it expressly for the benefit of the
next edition of the Right Reverend Doctor Whateley’s “Historical
Fallacies.” But to resume.</p>

<p>Guy, imparting a confidential statement of his identity and intentions
to the King, left him, to take up his abode in a cave, in a
cliff, near his residence; and at the gates of his own castle he received,
in the guise of a mendicant, alms of money and bread, from
the hands of his wife. I strongly suspect that the foundation of
this section of our legend rests upon the probable fact that Phillis
was of that quality which is said to belong to gray mares; and that
she led Guy a life which made him a miserable Guy indeed; and
that the poor henpecked man took to bad company abroad, and
met with small allowance of everything but reproach at home
And <i>so</i> he “died.”</p>

<p>A dramatic author of Charles I.’s reign, has, however, resuscitated
him in “A Tragical History of Guy, Earl of Warwick,” enacted
several times in presence of that monarch, and professedly
written by a certain “B. J.,” whom I do not at all suspect of being
Ben Jonson. The low comedy portion of this tragic drama is of
the filthiest sort, dealing in phrases and figures which I can hardly
conceive would now be tolerated in the lowest den of St. Giles’s,
certainly not out of it. If Charles heard this given more than
once, as the titlepage intimates, “more shame for him.” If his
Queen was present, she haply may not have understood the <i>verba
ad summam caveam spectantia</i>, and if a daughter could have been
at the royal entertainment, why then the very idea revolts one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
and pity is almost lost in indignation. That the author himself
thought well of the piece, which he printed in 1661, is proved by
the defiant epigraph which says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Carpere vel noli nostra vel ede tua.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I must not devote much space to a retrospective review of this
piece, particularly as the action begins after Guy has ceased to be
“Master,” and when, on his announcement of going to Jerusalem
(perhaps to the Jews to do a little business in bills), Phillis makes
some matronly remarks in a prospective sense, and a liberty of
illustration which would horrify a monthly nurse.</p>

<p>However, Guy goes forth and meets with a giant so huge, that
his squire Sparrow says it required four-and-twenty men to throw
mustard in his mouth when he dined. From such giants, Heaven
protects the errant Guy, and with a troop of fairies, wafts him to
Jerusalem. Here he finds Shamurath of Babylon assaulting the
city, but Guy heaps miracle on miracle of valor, and produces such
astounding results that Shamurath, who is a spectator of the deeds
and the doer; inquires, with a suspicion of Connaught in the accent
of the inquiry, “What divil or man is this?”</p>

<p>The infidel is more astonished than ever when Guy, after defeating
him, takes him into controversy, and laying hold of him as
Dr. Gumming does of Romanism, so buffets his belief that, the
soldier, fairly out of breath and argument, gives in, and declares
himself a Christian, on conviction.</p>

<p>During one-and-twenty years, Guy has a restless life through
the five acts of this edifying tragedy, and when he is seen again in
England, overcoming the Danes, he intimates to Athelstan that he
has six years more to pass in disguise, ere a vow, of which we
have before heard nothing, will be fulfilled. Athelstan receives
all that is said, in confidence; and promises affably, “upon my
word,” not to betray the secret. Guy is glad to hear that Phillis
is “pretty well;” and then he takes up his residence as I have before
told, according to the legend. He and an Angel occasionally
have a little abstruse disquisition; but the most telling scene is
doubtless where the bread is distributed to the beggars, by Phillis.
Guy is here disguised as a palmer, and Phillis inquires if he knew
the great Earl, to which Guy answers, with a wink of the eye, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
he and the Earl had often drank at the same crystal spring. But
Phillis is too dull, or too melancholy to trace her way through so
sorry a joke.</p>

<p>And now, just as the hour of completion of the vowed time of
his disguise, Guy takes to dying, and in that state he is found by
Rainhorn, the son who knows him not. He sends a token by the
young fellow to Phillis, who begins to suspect that the palmer who
used to be so particular in asking for “brown bread” at her gate,
must be the “Master Guy” of the days of sunny youth, short kirtles,
and long love-making. Mother and son haste to the spot, but
the vital spark has fled. Phillis exclaims, with much composed
thought, not unnatural in a woman whose husband has been seven-and-twenty
years away from home, and whose memory is good:
“If it be he, he has a mould-wart underneath his ear” to which
the son as composedly remarks, “View him, good mother, satisfy
your mind.” Thereupon the proper identification of the “party”
is established; and the widow is preparing to administer, without
will annexed, when Rainhorn bids her banish sorrow, as the King
is coming. The son evidently thinks the honor of a living king
should drown sorrow for a deceased parent; just as a Roman family
that can boast of a Pope in it, does not put on mourning even
when that Pope dies; the <i>having had him</i>, being considered a joy
that no grief should diminish.</p>

<p>Athelstan is evidently a King of Cockayne, for he affably expresses
surprise at the old traveller’s death, seeing, says his Majesty,
that “I had appointed <i>for</i> to meet Sir Guy” to which the son,
who has now succeeded to the estate, replies, in the spirit of an
heir who has been waiting long for an inheritance:—“that the
death has happened, and can not now be helped.”</p>

<p>But the most remarkable matter in this tragedy is that uttered
by Time, who plays prologue, epilogue, and interlude between the
acts. Whatever Charles may have thought of the piece, he was
doubtless well-pleased with Time, who addresses the audience in
verse, giving a political turn to the lesson on the stage. I dare
say the following lines were loudly applauded, if not by the king,
by the gallants, courtiers, and cavaliers generally:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“In Holy Land abroad Guy’s spirits roam,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And not in deans and chapters’ lands at home.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></div>
<div class="verse indent0">His sacred fury menaceth that nation,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Which held Judea under sequestration.</div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>He</i> doth not strike at surplices and tippets,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">To bring an olio in of sects and sippets;</div>
<div class="verse indent0">But deals his warlike and death-doing blows</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Against his Saviour’s and his sov’reign’s foes.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How the Royalist throats must have roared applause, and warrantably
too, at these genial lines; and how must the churchmen
in the pit have stamped with delight when Time subsequently assured
them that Guy took all his Babylonian prisoners to Jerusalem,
and had them probably christened by episcopally-ordained
ministers! If the house did not ring with the cheers of the Church-and-King
audience there, why they were unworthy of the instruction
filtered through legend and tragedy.</p>

<p>Such is the story of “Master Guy;” a story whose incidents
have doubtless meaning in them, but which were never turned to
more practical purpose than when they were employed to support
a tottering altar and a fallen throne. Reader, let us drink to the
immortal memory of <span class="smcap">Master Guy</span>; and having seen what sort
of man he was whom the king delighted to honor, let us see what
honors were instituted by kings for other deserving men.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">A brief</span> sketch of the history of the foundation of the Order of
the Garter will be found in another page. Confining myself here
to anecdotical detail, I will commence by observing, that in former
times, no Knight could be absent from two consecutive feasts of
the order, without being fined in a jewel, which he was to offer at
St. George’s altar. The fine was to be doubled every year, until
he had made atonement. Further, every knight was bound to wear
the Garter in public, wherever he might be, on pain of a mulct of
half a mark. Equally obligatory was it on the knight, in whatever
part of the world he was residing, or however he was engaged, to
wear the sanguine mantle of the order from the eve of St. George
till vesper-time on the morrow of the festival. Some of the chevaliers
who were in distant lands must have caused as much surprise
by their costume, as a Blue-coat boy does, wandering in his
strangely-colored garb, in the streets of Paris. I need not allude
to the absurd consequence which would attend the enforcing of
this arrangement in our own days. Hunting is generally over before
the eve of St. George’s day, and therefore a robed Knight of
the Garter could never be seen taking a double fence, ditch and
rail, at the tail of the “Melton Mowbray.” But even the sight of
half a dozen of them riding down Parliament street at the period
in question, would hardly be a stranger spectacle. A slight money
offering of a penny exempted any rather loose-principled knight
from attending divine service at St. George’s Chapel when he was
in or near Windsor. When a knight died, all his surviving comrades
were put to the expense of causing a certain number of
masses to be said for his soul. The sovereign-lord of the order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
had one thousand masses chanted in furtherance of his rescue from
purgatory. There was a graduated scale through the various
ranks till the knight-bachelor was come to. For him, only one
hundred masses were put up. This proves either that the knight’s
soul was not so difficult of deliverance from what Prince Gorschakoff
would call the “feu d’enfer,” or that the King’s was so heavily
pressed to the lowest depths of purgatory by its crimes, that it required
a decupled effort before it could be rescued.</p>

<p>“Companionship,” it may be observed, profited a knight in some
degree if, being knave as well as knight, he fell under the usual
sentence of being “drawn, hanged, and beheaded.” In such case,
a Knight of the Garter only suffered decapitation, as Sir Simon
Burley in 1388. The amount of favor shown to the offending
knight did not admit of his being conscious of much gratitude to
him at whose hands it was received. It may be mentioned, that
it did not always follow that a nobleman elected to be knight willingly
accepted the proffered Garter. The first who refused it,
after due election, in 1424, was the Duke of Burgundy. He
declined it with as much scorn as Uhland did the star of merit
offered to the poet by the present King of Bavaria.</p>

<p>In treating of stage knights, I shall be found to have placed at
their head Sir John Falstaff. The original of that character according
to some namely, Sir John Fastolf, claims some notice here,
as a Knight of the Garter who was no more the coward which he
was said to be, than Falstaff is the bloated buffoon which some
commentators take him for. Sir John Fastolf was elected Knight
of the Garter in 1426. Monstrelet says he was removed from
the order for running away, without striking a blow, at the battle
of Patay. Shakespeare’s popular Sir John has nothing in common
with this other Sir John, but we have Falstolf himself in
Henry VI. act iv. sc. 1, with Talbot, alluding to his vow, that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent13">“When I did meet thee next,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">To tear the Garter from thy craven’s leg,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">The which I have done, because unworthily</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Thou wast installed in that high degree.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This sort of suspension or personal deprivation was never allowed
by the rules of the order, which enjoined the forms for degrading
a knight who was proved to have acted cowardly. The battle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
Patay was fought in 1429; and as there is abundant testimony
of Sir John having been in possession of the Garter and all its
honors long after that period; and, further, that his tomb in Pulham
Mary, Norfolk, represented him in gilt armor, with his crest
and two escutcheons, with the cross of St. George within the order,
we may fairly conclude that if the charge was ever made, of which
there is no trace, it assuredly never was proven.</p>

<p>If there were some individuals who refused to accept the honor
at all, there were others who were afraid to do so without curious
inquiry. Thus, in the reign of Henry VI. we hear of the embassador
from Frederick III. Emperor of Germany (one Sir Hertook
von Clux), stating that his master wishes to know “what it
would stand him in, if he were to be admitted into the honorable
order!” Cautious Austria!</p>

<p>There are examples both of courtesy and sarcasm among the
Knights of the Garter. I may cite, for instance, the case of the
Duke of York, in the reign of Henry VI. <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1453. The King
was too ill to preside at the Chapter; the Duke of Buckingham
was his representative; and the Duke of York, so little scrupulous
in most matters, excused himself from attending on this occasion,
because, as he said, “the sovereign having for some time
been angry with him, he durst not attend, lest he should incur his
further displeasure, and thereby aggravate the illness under which
the King was suffering.” When the same Duke came into power,
he gave the Garter to the most useful men of the York party,
beheading a few Lancastrian knights in order to make way for
them. At the Chapter held for the purpose of electing the York
aspirants, honest John de Foix, Earl of Kendal, declined to vote
at all. He alleged that he was unable to discern whether the candidates
were “without reproach” or not, and he left the decision
to clearsighted people. The Earl was a Lancastrian, and he thus
evaded the disagreeable act of voting for personal and political
enemies.</p>

<p>But whatever the intensity of dislike one knight may have had
against another, there were occasions on which they went, hand
in hand, during the celebration of mass, to kiss that esteemable
relic, the heart of St. George. This relic had been brought to
England by the Emperor Sigismund. Anstis remarks, after alluding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
to the obstinacy of those who will not believe all that St.
Ambrose says touching the facts of St. George, his slaying of the
dragon, and his rescue of a royal virgin, that “whosoever is so
refractory as obstinately to condemn every part of this story, is not
to be bore with.” He then adds: “this true martyr and excellent
and valued soldier of Christ, after many unspeakable torments inflicted
on him by an impious tyrant, when he had bent his head,
and was just ready to give up the ghost, earnestly entreated Almighty
God, that whoever, in remembrance of him, and his
name, should devoutly ask anything, might be heard, a voice
instantly came from Heaven, signifying that that was granted
which he had requested.... While living, by prayer he
obtained that whoever should fly to him for his intercession, should
not pray nor cry out in vain. He ordered the trunk of his body,
which had origin from among infidels, to be sent to them, that
they whom he had not been able to serve, when living, might
receive benefit from him, when dead; that those infidels who by
any misfortune had lost their senses, by coming to him or his
chapel, might be restored to soundness of mind and judgment.
His head and other members were to be carried, some one way
and some another. But his heart, the emblem of lively love, was
bequeathed wholly to Christians, for whom he had the most fervent
affection. Not to all them in general, though Christians, but to Englishmen
alone; and not to every part of England, but only to his
own Windsor, which on this account must have been more pleasing
to the sovereigns and all other the knights of this most illustrious
order. Thus his heart, together with a large portion of his skull,
is there kept with due honor and veneration. Sigismund, Emperor
of Alemain, always august, being chosen in this honorable
order, presented this heart to the invincible Henry V., who gave
orders to have it preserved in that convenient place, where he had
already instituted for himself solemn exequies for ever, that the
regard he had for all others might be past dispute.” This is very
far, indeed, from being logical, but the fact remains that during
the reign of Henry VI., the heart seems to have been regarded
with more than usual reverence by the knights of the two factions
which were rending England. Each hoped to win St. George
for a confederate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>The chapters were not invariably held at Windsor, nor in such
solemn localities as a chapel. In 1445, Henry VI., held a chapter
at the Lion Inn in Brentford. In this hostelrie the King created
Sir Thomas Hastings and Sir Alonzo d’Almade, Knights of the
Garter. To the latter, who was also made Earl of Avranches,
in the best room of a Brentford inn, the monarch also presented
a gold cup. The whole party seems to have made a night of it in
the pleasant locality, and the new chevaliers were installed the
next morning—after which, probably, mulled sack went round in
the golden cup.</p>

<p>Shakespeare makes Richard III. swear by his George, his
Garter, and his Crown; but the George and Collar were novelties
introduced by Henry VII. The latter King held one of the
most splendid chapters which ever assembled, at York, prefacing
the work there by riding with all the knights, in their robes, to
the morning mass of requiem, and following it up by similarly
riding to even-sung. This was more decent than Henry VI.’s
tavern chapter of the (Red) Lion, in Brentford. Henry VII.
was fond of the solemn splendor of installations, at which he
changed his costume like a versatile actor, was surrounded by
ladies as well as knights, and had Skelton, the poet, near to take
notes for songs and sonnets, descriptive of the occasion. A sovereign
of the order, like Henry VII., so zealous to maintain its
splendor and efficiency, merited the gift which was conferred upon
him by the Cardinal of Rouen—of the bones of one of the legs
of St. George. The saint had many legs, but it is not said where
these bones were procured, and they who beheld them, at the
chapter held in St. Paul’s Cathedral in 1505, probably little
troubled themselves as to whence the precious relics were derived.
Henry, in return, left an image of St. George, of one hundred
and forty ounces, adorned with masses of precious stones, to the
College of Windsor, “there to remain <i>while the world shall endure</i>,
to be set upon the high altar at all solemn feasts.” Leg bones
and costly image would now be sought for in vain. The world
has outlived them, and suffers nothing by their loss.</p>

<p>It was the successor of Richmond, namely Henry VIII. who
granted to these knights what may be termed a sumptuary privilege,
that of being permitted to wear woollen cloth made out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
the realm. None but a knight, save the peers, dared don a coat
or mantle made of foreign cloth. In love of splendor, Henry was
equal to his predecessor, and perhaps never was a more brilliant
spectacle seen than on the 27th of May, 1519, when the King and
a glittering cortège rode from Richmond to Windsor, and changed
steeds and drank a cup at the “Catherine’s Wheel,” in Colnbrook,
by the way. The Queen and a galaxy of ladies met them in Eton,
and the usual solemnities were followed by a gorgeous banquet,
at which there were such meat and music as had scarcely ever
been so highly enjoyed at a festival before. The middle of the
hall was crowded with spectators, but at the close of the repast,
these were turned out, when “the King was served of his void,
the knights also, standing all along”—which must have been a
remarkably edifying exhibition.</p>

<p>Henry re-modelled the order, and framed the statutes by which
it is now chiefly governed. Among them was the one directing
that no person of mean birth should be elected, and this the King
himself very speedily broke, by electing Thomas Cromwell. The
latter returned thanks for the honor in the very humblest strain,
and while he seemed conscious that he was entirely unworthy of
the distinction, he appeared desirous to assure the sneering knights’
companions who had been compelled to give him their suffrages,
that ignoble as he was, he would imitate nobility as closely as possible.
But there were men, from the period of the institution of
the order downward to Henry’s time, who, if of higher birth than
Cromwell, were not of higher worth. Very many had forfeited
their dignity as knights by treasonable practices; and Henry
decreed that wherever these names occurred in the records, the
words “Vœ Proditor!”—Out upon the traitor—should be written
against them in the margin. The text had thus a truly Tudor
comment.</p>

<p>Under the succeeding sovereign, Edward VI., a great portion
of the splendor of the religious ceremonies at the installation was
abolished. It was in this reign that Northumberland procured
the ejection of Lord Paget from the order, on the ground that the
meanness of his birth had always disqualified him, or as Edward
VI. says in his journal, “for divers his offences, and <i>chiefly</i> because
he was no gentleman of blood, neither of father-side nor mother-side.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
Lord Paget, however, was restored under Mary, and the
record of his degradation was removed from the register.</p>

<p>Under Mary, if there was some court servility there was also
some public spirit. When the Queen created her husband Philip
a knight, an obsequious herald, out of compliment to the “joint-sovereigns,”
took down the arms of England in the chapel at
Windsor, and was about to set up those of Spain. This, however,
was forbidden “by certain lords,” and brave men they were, for
in such a display of English spirit there was peril of incurring
the ill-will of Mary, who was never weary of heaping favors on
the foreign King-consort, whom she would have made generalissimo
of her forces if she had dared. It is a curious fact that
Philip was not ejected from the order, even when he had despatched
the Spanish Armada to devastate the dominions of the
sovereign.</p>

<p>In illustration of the fact that the Garter never left the leg of a
knight of the order, there are some lines by the Elizabethan poet
Peele, which are very apt to the occasion. Speaking of the Earl
of Bedford, Peele says—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">—“Dead is Bedford! virtuous and renowned</div>
<div class="verse indent0">For arms, for honor, and religious love;</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And yet alive his name in Fame’s records,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">That held his Garter dear, and wore it well.</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Some worthy wight but blazon his deserts:</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Only a tale I thought on by the way,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">As I observed his honorable name.</div>

<div class="verse indent0">This aged earl in his apparel plain,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Wrapt in his russet gown, lay down to rest,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">His badge of honor buckled to his leg.</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Bare and naked. There came a pilfering swad</div>

<div class="verse indent0">Right grave and honorable, that importeth much—</div>
<div class="verse indent0">‘Evil be to him,’ it saith, ‘that evil thinks.’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Elizabeth was distinguished for loving to hold newly-chosen
knights in suspense, before she ratified their election by her approval.
The anniversary banquets too fell into disuse during her
reign, and she introduced the most unworthy knight that had ever
stood upon the record of the order. This was Charles IX. of
France. On the other hand she sent the Garter to Henri Quatre.
He was the last French monarch who was a companion of the
order, till the reign of Louis XVIII. On the day the latter came
up from Hartwell to Stanmore, on his way to France, at the period
of the first restoration, the Prince Regent invested him with
the brilliant insignia at Carlton House. It was on this occasion
Louis XVIII. observed that he was the first King of France who
had worn the garter since the period of Henri Quatre. Louis had
erased his own name from the Golden Book of Nobility of Venice,
when he heard that the name of Bonaparte had been inserted
therein. He, perhaps, would have declined receiving the Garter,
if he could have foreseen that the royal niece of the Prince Regent
would, in after years, confer the order on the imperial nephew
of Napoleon.</p>

<p>The period of James is marked by some pretty quarrels among
the officials. Thus at the installation of Prince Henry, there was
a feast which was well nigh turned into a fray. At the very beginning
of it, the prebends and heralds fell to loggerheads on the
delicate question of precedency. The alms-knights mingled in the
quarrel by siding with the prebends, and claiming the next degree
of precedency before the heralds. Reference was made to the
Earls of Nottingham and Worcester. The referees adjudged the
heralds to have right of precedency before the prebends. Thereupon
the proud prebends, oblivious of Christian humility, refused
to go to church at the tail of the heralds. The latter went in exultingly
without them, and the prebends would not enter until a
long time had elapsed, so that it could not be said they followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
the gentlemen of the tabard. The delicate question was again
angrily discussed, and at length referred to the whole body of
knights. The noble fraternity, after grave deliberation, finally
determined that on the next day of St. George, being Sunday, in
the procession to the church, the alms-knights should go first, then
the pursuivants of arms, then the prebends (many of whom were
doctors of divinity), and finally the heralds. The latter were cunning
rogues, and no inconsiderable authority in matters of precedency;
and they immediately declared that the knights had decreed
to them the better place, inasmuch as that in most processions the
principal personages did not walk first.</p>

<p>Of the knights of this reign, Grave Maurice, Prince of Orange,
and Frederick the (Goody) Palsgrave of the Rhine, were among
the most celebrated. They were installed in 1613, the Prince by
proxy, and the Palsgrave in person. A young and graceful
Count Ludovic of Nassau, was chosen at the last moment, to represent
the Prince, whose appointed representative, Count Henry,
was detained in Holland by adverse winds. “The feast,” says an
eye-witness, “was in the Great Hall, where the king dined at the
upper table alone, served in state by the Lord Gerard as Sewer,
the Lord Morris as Cupbearer, the Lord Compton as Carver; all
that were of the order, at a long cross table across the hall. The
Prince by himself alone, and the Palatine a little distance from
him. But the Count Nassau was ranged over-against my Lord
Admiral, and so took place of all after the Sovereign Princes, not
without a little muttering of our Lords, who would have had him
ranged according to seniority, if the king had not overruled it by prerogative.”</p>

<p>Wilson, in his history of James I., narrates a curious anecdote
respecting this Grave Maurice and the ribbon of the
order. “Prince Maurice took it as a great honor to be admitted
into the Fraternity of that Order, and wore it constantly; till
afterward, some villains at the Hague, that met the reward of their
demerit (one of them, a Frenchman, being groom of the Prince’s
chamber) robbed a jeweller of Amsterdam that brought jewels to
the Prince. This groom, tempting him into his chamber, to see
some jewels, there, with his confederates, strangled the man with
one of the Prince’s Blue Ribbons; which being afterward discovered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
the Prince would never suffer so fatal an instrument to come
about his neck.”</p>

<p>James, by raising his favorite Buckingham, then only Sir George
Villiers, to the degree of Knight of the Garter, was considered to
have as much outraged the order as Henry VIII. had done by
investing Cromwell with the insignia. Chamberlain, in a letter to
Sir Dudley Carleton, says, “The King went away the next day
after St. George’s Feast, toward Newmarket and Thetford, the
Earl of Rutland and Sir George Villiers being that morning
elected into the order of the Garter, which seemed at first a strange
choice, in regard that the wife of the former is an open and known
recusant, and <i>he</i> is said to have many dangerous people about him;
and the latter is so lately come into the sight of the world, and
withal it is doubted that he had not sufficient likelihood to maintain
the dignity of the place, according to express articles of the order.
But to take away that scruple, the King hath bestowed upon him
the Lord Gray’s lands, and means, they say, to mend his grant
with much more, not far distant, in the present possession of the
Earl of Somerset, if he do <i>cadere causâ</i> and sink in the business
now in hand.” The last passage alludes to the murder of Overbury.</p>

<p>The going down to Windsor was at this time a pompous spectacle.
The riding thither of the Knights Elect is thus spoken of
by a contemporary: “On Monday,” (St. George’s day, 1615),
“our Knights of the Garter, Lord Fenton and Lord Knollys, ride
to Windsor, with great preparation to re-vie one with another who
shall make the best show. Though I am of opinion the latter
will carry it by many degrees, by reason of the alliance with the
houses of the Howards, Somerset, Salisbury, and Dorset, with
many other great families that will bring him their friends, and
most part of the pensioners. Yet most are persuaded the other
will bear away the bell, as having the best part of the court, all
the bed-chamber, all the prince’s servants and followers, with a
hundred of the Guard, that have new rich coats made on purpose,
besides Sir George Villiers (the favorite), and Mr. Secretary—whose
presence had been better forborne, in my judgment, for
many reasons—but that every man abound in his own sense.”
James endeavored to suppress, in some measure, the expensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
ride of the Knights Elect to Windsor, but only with partial success.
His attempted reform, too, had a selfish aspect; he tried to
make it profitable to himself. He prohibited the giving of livery
coats, “for saving charge and avoiding emulation,” and at the same
time ordered that all existing as well as future companions should
present a piece of plate of the value of twenty pounds sterling at
least for the use of the altar in St. George’s Chapel.</p>

<p>Charles I. held chapters in more places in England than any
other king—now at York, now at Nottingham, now at Oxford,
and in other localities. These chapters were sometimes attended
by as few as four knights, and for the most part they were shorn
of much of the ancient ceremony. He held some brilliant chapters
at Windsor, nevertheless. At one of them, the election of
the Earl of Northumberland inspired a bard, whose song I subjoin
because it is illustrative of several incidents which are far from
lacking interest.</p>

<p>This illustrative ballad bears the initials “M. P.” These,
probably, do not imply either a member of Parliament, or of the
house of Percy. Beneath the initials we have the legend, “Printed
at London, for Francis Coules, and are” (verses <i>subaudiuntur</i>) “to
be sold at his shop in the Old Bayley.” There are three woodcuts
to illustrate the text. The first represents the Earl on horseback;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
both peer and charger are very heavily caparisoned, and
the steed looks as intelligent as the peer. In front of this stately,
solid, and leisurely pacing couple, is a mounted serving-man,
armed with a stick, and riding full gallop at nobody. The illustration
to the second part represents the Earl returning from Windsor
in a carriage, which looks very much like the Araba in the
Turkish Exhibition. The new Knight wears his hat, cloak, collar
and star; his figure, broad-set to the doorway, bears no distant
resemblance to the knave of clubs, and his aristocratic self-possession
and serenity are remarkable, considering the bumping he is
getting, as implied by the wheels of his chariot being several
inches off the ground. The pace of the steeds, two and twohalves
of whom are visible, is not, however, very great. They are hardly
out of a walk. But perhaps the bareheaded coachman and the
as bareheaded groom have just pulled them up, to allow the running
footmen to reach the carriage. Two of these are seen near
the rear of the vehicle, running like the brace of mythological
personages in Ovid, who ran the celebrated match in which the
apples figured so largely. The tardy footmen have just come in
sight of their lord, who does not allow his serenity to be disturbed
by chiding them. The Percy wears as stupid an air as his servants,
and the only sign of intelligence anywhere in the group is
to be found in the off-side wheeler, whose head is turned back,
with a sneering cast in the face, as if he were ridiculing the idea of
the whole show, and was possessed with the conviction that he was
drawing as foolish a beast as himself.</p>

<p>The Earl appears to have ridden eastward, in the direction
pointed by his own lion’s tale, before he drove down to Windsor.
The show seems to have interested all ranks between the Crown
and the Conduit in Fleet street. Where Viscount Wimbledon’s
house was, “in the fairest part of the Strand,” I can not conjecture,
and as I can not find information on this point in Mr. Peter Cunningham’s
“Hand-Book of London,” I conclude that the site is not
known.</p>

<p>In connection with Charles I. and his Garter, I will here cite a
passage from the third volume of Mr. Macaulay’s “History of
England,” page 165. “Louvois hated Lauzun. Lauzun was a
favorite at St. Germains. He wore the Garter, a badge of honor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
which has very seldom been conferred on aliens who were not
sovereign princes. It was believed, indeed, in the French court,
that in order to distinguish him from the other knights of the most
illustrious of European orders, he had been decorated with that
very George which Charles I. had, on the scaffold, put into the
hands of Juxon.” Lauzun, I shall have to notice under the head
of foreign knights. I revert here to the George won by Charles
and given to Lauzun. It was a very extraordinary jewel, curiously
cut in an onyx, set about with twenty-one large table diamonds, in
the fashion of a garter. On the under side of the George was the
portrait of Henrietta Maria, “rarely well limned,” says Ashmole,
“and set in a case of gold, the lid neatly enamelled with goldsmith’s
work, and surrounded with another Garter, adorned with
a like number of equal-sized diamonds, as was the foresaid.” The
onyx George of Charles I. was in the possession of the late Duke
of Wellington, and is the property of the present Duke.</p>

<p>There is something quite as curious touching the history of the
Garter worn by Charles I., as what Mr. Macaulay tells concerning
the George. The diamonds upon it, forming the motto, were
upward of four hundred in number. On the day of the execution,
this valuable ornament fell into the hands of one of Cromwell’s
captains of cavalry, named Pearson. After one exchange of
hands, it was sold to John Ireton, sometime Lord-Mayor of London,
for two hundred and five pounds. At the Restoration, a
commission was appointed to look after the scattered royal property
generally; and the commissioners not only recovered some
pictures belonging to Charles, from Mrs. Cromwell, who had placed
them in charge of a tradesman in Thames street, but they discovered
that Ireton held the Garter, and they summoned him to deliver
it up accordingly. It has been said that the commissioners
offered him the value of the jewel if he would surrender it. This
is not the case. The report had been founded on a misapprehension
of terms. Ireton did not deny that he possessed the Garter
by purchase, whereupon “composition was offered him, according
to the direction of the Commission, as in all other like cases where
anything could not be had in kind.” That is, he was ordered to
surrender the jewel, or if this had been destroyed, its value, or
some compensation in lieu thereof. Ireton refused the terms altogether.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
The King, Charles II., thereupon sued him in the Court
of King’s Bench, where the royal plaintiff obtained a verdict for
two hundred and five pounds, and ten pounds costs of suit.</p>

<p>In February, 1652, the Parliament abolished all titles and honors
conferred by Charles I. since the 4th of January, two years
previously. This was done on the ground that the late King had
conferred such titles and honors, in order to promote his wicked
and treacherous designs against the parliament and people of England.
A fine of one hundred pounds was decreed against every
offender, whenever he employed the abolished title, with the exception
of a knight, who was let off at the cheaper rate of forty
pounds. Any one convicted of addressing a person by any of the
titles thus done away with, was liable to a fine of ten shillings.
The Parliament treated with silent contempt the titles and orders
of knighthood conferred by Charles I. As monarchy was defunct,
these adjuncts of monarchy were considered as defunct also. The
Protector did not create a single Knight of the Garter, nor of the
Bath. “<i>These</i> orders,” says Nicolas, “were never formally abolished,
but they were probably considered so inseparably united to
the person, name, and office of a king, as to render it impossible
for any other authority to create them.” Cromwell, however, made
one peer, Howard, Viscount Howard of Morpeth, ten baronets and
knights, and conferred certain degrees of precedency. It was seldom
that he named an unworthy person, considering the latter in
the Protector’s own point of view, but the Restoration was no
sooner an accomplished fact, when to ridicule one of Oliver’s
knights was a matter of course with the hilarious dramatic poets.
On this subject something will be found under the head of “Stage
Knights.” Meanwhile, although there is nothing to record touching
Knights of the Garter, under the Commonwealth, we may notice
an incident showing that Garter King-at-arms was not altogether
idle. This incident will be sufficiently explained by the
following extract from the third volume of Mr. Macaulay’s “History
of England.” The author is speaking of the regicide Ludlow,
who, since the Restoration, had been living in exile at Geneva.
“The Revolution opened a new prospect to him. The right of
the people to resist oppression, a right which, during many years,
no man could assert without exposing himself to ecclesiastical anathemas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
and to civil penalties, had been solemnly recognised by
the Estates of the realm, and had been proclaimed by Garter
King-at-arms, on the very spot where the memorable scaffold had
been set up.”</p>

<p>Charles II. did not wait for the Restoration in order to make or
unmake knights. He did not indeed hold chapters, but at St.
Germains, in Jersey, and other localities, he unknighted knights
who had forgotten their allegiance in the “late <i>horrid</i> rebellion,”
as he emphatically calls the Parliamentary and Cromwellian
periods, and authorized other individuals to wear the insignia,
while he exhorted them to wait patiently and hopefully for their
installations at Windsor. At St. Germains, he gave the Garter to
his favorite Buckingham; and from Jersey he sent it to two far
better men—Montrose, and Stanley, Earl of Derby. The worst
enemies of these men could not deny their chivalrous qualities.
Montrose on the scaffold, when they hung (in derision) from his
neck the book in which were recorded his many brave deeds, very
aptly said that he wore the record of his courage with as much
pride as he ever wore the Garter. Stanley’s chivalry was never
more remarkable than in the skirmish previous to Worcester, when
in the hot affray, he received seven shots in his breast-plate, thirteen
cuts on his beaver, five or six wounds on his arms and shoulders,
and had two horses killed under him. When he was about
to die, he returned the Garter, by the hands of a faithful servant,
to the king, “in all humility and gratitude,” as he remarked, “spotless
and free from any stain, as he received it, according to the
honorable example of my ancestors.”</p>

<p>Charles made knights of the Garter of General Monk and Admiral
Montague. The chapter for election was held in the Abbey
of St. Augustine’s at Canterbury. It was the first convenient place
which the king could find for such a purpose after landing. “They
were the only two,” says Pepys, “for many years who had the
Garter given them before they had honor of earldom, or the like,
excepting only the Duke of Buckingham, who was only Sir George
Villiers when he was made a knight of the Garter.” The honor
was offered to Clarendon, but declined as above his deserts, and
likely to create him enemies. James, Duke of York, however,
angrily attributed Clarendon’s objection to being elected to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
Garter to the fact that James himself had asked it for him, and
that the Chancellor was foolishly unwilling to accept any honor
that was to be gained by the Duke’s mediation.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to the next reign, let me remark that the
George and Garter of Charles II. had as many adventures or misadventures
as those of his father. In the fight at Worcester his
collar and garter became the booty of Cromwell, who despatched
a messenger with them to the Parliament, as a sign and trophy of
victory. The king’s lesser George, set with diamonds, was preserved
by Colonel Blague. It passed through several hands with
much risk. It at length fell again into the hands of the Colonel
when he was a prisoner in the Tower. Blague, “considering it
had already passed so many dangers, was persuaded it could yet
secure one hazardous attempt of his own.” The enthusiastic royalist
looked upon it as a talisman that would rescue him from captivity.
Right or wrong in his sentiment, the result was favorable.
He succeeded in making his escape, and had the gratification of
restoring the George to his sovereign.</p>

<p>The short reign of James II. offers nothing worthy of the notice
of the general reader with respect to this decoration; and the
same may be said of the longer reign of William III. The little
interest in the history of the order under Queen Anne, is in connection
with her foreign nominations, of which due notice will be
found in the succeeding section. Small, too, is the interest connected
with these matters in the reign of George I., saving, indeed, that
under <i>him</i> we find the last instance of the degradation of a knight
of the garter, in the person of James, Duke of Ormund, who had
been attainted of high treason. His degradation took place on the
12th July, 1716. The elections were numerous during this reign.
The only one that seems to demand particular notice is that of
Sir Robert Walpole, First Lord of the Treasury. He gave up
the Bath on receiving the Garter in 1726, and he was the only
commoner who had received the distinction since Sir George Monk
and Sir Edward Montague were created, sixty-six years previously.</p>

<p>The first circumstance worthy of record under George II. is,
that the color of the garter and ribbon was changed from light
blue to dark, or “Garter-blue,” as it is called. This was done in
order to distinguish the companions made by Brunswick from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
those assumed to be fraudulently created by the Pretender Stuart.
Another change was effected, but much less felicitously. What
with religious, social, and political revolution, it was found that the
knights were swearing to statutes which they could not observe.
Their consciences were disturbed thereat—at least they said so;
but their sovereign set them at ease by enacting that in future all
knights should promise to break no statutes, except on dispensation
from the sovereign! This left the matter exactly where it had
been previously.</p>

<p>The first circumstance worthy of attention in the reign of
George III., was that of the election of Earl Gower, president
of the council, in 1771. The sharp eye of Junius discovered that
the election was a farce, for in place of the sovereign and at least
six knights being present, as the statutes required, there were only
four knights present, the Dukes of Gloucester, Newcastle, Northumberland,
and the Earl of Hertford. The first duke too was
there against his will. He had, says Junius, “entreated, begged,
and implored,” to be excused from attending that chapter—but all
in vain. The new knight seems to have been illegally elected,
and as illegally installed. The only disagreeable result was to the
poor knights of Windsor. People interested in the subject had
made remarks, and while the illegal election of the president of
the council was most properly put before the King, representation
was made to him that the poor knights had been wickedly contravening
their statutes, for a very long period. They had for years
been permitted to reside with their families wherever they chose
to fix their residence. This was pronounced irregular, and George
III., so lax with regard to Lord Gower, was very strict with respect
to these poor knights. They were all commanded to reside
in their apartments attached to Windsor Castle, and there keep
up the poor dignity of their noble order, by going to church twice
every day in full uniform. There were some of them at that
period who would as soon have gone out twice a day to meet the
dragon.</p>

<p>The order of the Garter was certainly ill-used by this sovereign.
In order to admit all his sons, he abolished the statute of Edward
(who had as many sons as George had when he made the absurd
innovation, but who did not care to make knights of them <i>because</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
they were his sons), confining the number of companions to
twenty-five. Henceforward, the sovereign’s sons were to reckon
only as over and above that number. As if this was not sufficiently
absurd, the king subsequently decreed eligibility of election
to an indefinite number of persons, provided only that they could
trace their descent from King George II.!</p>

<p>No Companion so well deserved the honor conferred upon him
as he who was the most illustrious of the English knights created
during the sway of the successor of George III., as Regent;
namely, the late Duke of Wellington. Mr. Macaulay, when detailing
the services and honors conferred on Schomberg, has a passage
in which he brings the names of these two warriors, dukes,
and knights of the Garter, together. “The House of Commons
had, with general approbation, compensated the losses of Schomberg,
and rewarded his services by a grant of a hundred thousand
pounds. Before he set out for Ireland, he requested permission
to express his gratitude for this magnificent present. A chair was
set for him within the bar. He took his seat there with the mace
at his right hand, rose, and in a few graceful words returned his
thanks and took his leave. The Speaker replied that the Commons
could never forget the obligation under which they already
lay to his Grace, that they saw him with pleasure at the head of
an English army, that they felt entire confidence in his zeal and
ability, and that at whatever distance he might be he would always
be, in a peculiar manner, an object of their care. The precedent
set on this interesting occasion was followed with the utmost minuteness,
a hundred and twenty-five years later, on an occasion
more interesting still. Exactly on the same spot, on which, in
July, 1689, Schomberg had acknowledged the liberality of the
nation, a chair was set in July, 1814, for a still more illustrious
warrior, who came to return thanks for a still more splendid mark
of public gratitude.”</p>

<p>There is nothing calling for particular notice in the history of
the Order since the election of the last-named knight. Not one
on whose shoulders has been placed “the robe of heavenly color,”
earned so hardly and so well the honor of companionship. This
honor, however, costs every knight who submits to the demand,
not less than one hundred and eight pounds sterling, in fees. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
is, in itself, a heavy fine inflicted on those who render extraordinary
service to the country, and to whom are presented the order
of the Garter, and an order from the Garter King-at-arms to pay
something more than a hundred guineas in return. The fine,
however, is generally paid with alacrity; for, though the non-payment
does not unmake a knight, it has the effect of keeping his
name from the register.</p>

<p>I have already observed that Mr. Macaulay, in his recently-published
History, has asserted that very few foreigners, except
they were sovereign princes, were ever admitted into the companionship
of the Garter. Let us, then, look over the roll of illustrious
aliens, and see how far this assertion is correct.</p>
<hr class="full x-ebookmaker-drop">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c11">FOREIGN KNIGHTS OF THE GARTER.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">There</span> is some error in Mr. Macaulay’s statement, which, as a
matter of history, may be worth correcting. So far from there
having been few aliens, except sovereign princes, admitted into
the order, the fact, save in recent times, is exactly the reverse.
The order contemplated the admission of foreigners, from the
very day of its foundation. On that day, three foreigners were
admitted, none of whom was a sovereign prince. Not one of the
foreign sovereigns with whom Edward was in alliance, nor any of
the royal relatives of the Queen, were among the original companions.
The aliens, who were not sovereign princes, were the
Captal de Buch, a distinguished Gascon nobleman, and two bannerets
or knights, who with the other original companions had
served in the expeditions sent by Edward against France.</p>

<p>Again, under Richard II., among the most famous alien gentlemen
created knights of the Garter, were the Gascon soldier Du
Preissne; Soldan de la Tour, Lord of much land in Xaintonge;
the Dutch Count William of Ostervant, who made a favor of accepting
the honorable badge; the Duke of Bavaria (not yet Emperor),
and Albert, Duke of Holland, who was hardly a sovereign
prince, but who, nevertheless, may be accounted as such, seeing
that, in a small way indeed, more like a baron than a monarch, he
exercised some sovereign rights. The Duke of Britanny may,
with more justice, be included in the list of sovereign dukes who
were members of the order. Under Henry IV., neither alien
noble nor foreign prince appears to have been elected, but under
his successor, fifth of the name, Eric X., King of Denmark, and
John I., King of Portugal, were created companions. They were
the first kings regnant admitted to the order. Some doubt exists
as to the date of their admission, but none as to their having been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
knights’ companions. Dabrichecourt is the name of a gentleman
lucky enough to have been also elected during this reign, but I do
not know if he were of foreign birth or foreign only by descent.
The number of the fraternity became complete in this reign, by
the election of the Emperor Sigismund. Under Henry V., the
foreign sovereign princes, members of the order, were unquestionably
more numerous than the mere alien gentlemen; but reckoning
from the foundation, there had been a greater number of foreign
knights not of sovereign quality than of those who were.
The sovereign princes did not seem to care so much for the honor
as private gentlemen in foreign lands. Thus the German, Sir
Hartook von Clux, accepted the honor with alacrity, but the King
of Denmark allowed five years to pass before he intimated that he
cheerfully or resignedly tendered his acceptance. At the first anniversary
festival of the Order, held under Henry VI., as many
robes of the order were made for alien knights not sovereign
princes, as for gartered monarchs of foreign birth. The foreign
princes had so little appreciated the honor of election, that when
the Sovereign Duke of Burgundy was proposed, under Henry VI.,
the knights would not go to election until that potentate had declared
whether he would accept the honor. His potentiality
declared very distinctly that he would not; and he is the first
sovereign prince who positively refused to become a knight of the
Garter! In the same reign Edward, King of Portugal, was elected
in the place of his father, John:—this is one of the few instances
in which the honor has passed from father to son. The Duke of
Coimbra, also elected in this reign, was of a foreign princely house,
but he was not a sovereign prince. He may reckon with the
alien knights generally. The Duke of Austria too, Albert, was
elected before he came to a kingly and to an imperial throne; and
against these princes I may place the name of Gaston de Foix,
whom Henry V. had made Earl of Longueville, as that of a simple
alien knight of good estate and knightly privileges. One or
two scions of royal houses were elected, as was Alphonso, King
of Aragon. But there is strong reason for believing that Alphonso
declined the honor. There is some uncertainty as to the period
of the election of Frederick III., that economical Emperor of
Austria, who begged to know what the expenses would amount to,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
before he would “accept the order.” All the garters not home-distributed,
did not go to deck the legs of foreign sovereign princes.
Toward the close of the reign we find the Vicomte de Chastillion
elected, and also D’Almada, the Portuguese knight of whose jolly
installation at the Lion in Brentford, I have already spoken. An
Aragonese gentleman, Francis de Surienne, was another alien
knight of simply noble quality; he was elected in the King’s bedchamber
at Westminster; and the alien knights would more than
balance the foreign sovereign princes, even if we throw in Casimir,
King of Poland, who was added to the confraternity under the
royal Lancastrian.</p>

<p>The first foreigner whom Edward IV. raised to companionship
in the order, was not a prince, but a private gentleman named
Gaillard Duras or Durefort. The honor was conferred in acknowledgment
of services rendered to the King, in France; and
the new knight was very speedily deprived of it, for traitorously
transferring his services to the King of France. Of the foreign
monarchs who are said to have been <i>elected</i> companions, during
this reign—namely, the Kings of Spain and Portugal—there is
much doubt whether the favor was conferred at all. The Dukes
of Ferrara and Milan were created knights, and these may be
reckoned among ducal sovereigns, although less than kings; and let
me add that, if the Kings of Spain and Portugal <i>were</i> elected, the
elections became void, because these monarchs failed to send
proxies to take possession of their stalls. Young Edward V.
presided at no election, and his uncle and successor, Richard III.,
received no foreign prince into the order. At the installation,
however, of the short-lived son of Richard, that sovereign created
Geoffrey de Sasiola, embassador from the Queen of Spain, a knight,
by giving him three blows on the shoulders with a sword, and by
investing him with a gold collar.</p>

<p>Henry VII. was not liberal toward foreigners with the many
garters which fell at his disposal, after Bosworth, and during his
reign. He appears to have exchanged with Maximilian, the Garter
for the Golden Fleece, and to have conferred the same decoration
on one or two heirs to foreign thrones, who were not sovereign
princes when elected. It was not often that these princes
were installed in person. Such installation, however, did occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
happen; and never was one more singular in its origin and
circumstances, than that of Philip, Archduke of Austria. Philip
had resolved to lay claim to the throne of Spain by right of his
wife Joan, daughter of Ferdinand of Castile and Aragon. He
was on his way to Spain, when foul winds and a tempestuous sea
drove him into Weymouth. Henry invited him to Windsor,
treated him with great hospitality, and installed him Knight of the
Garter. Philip “took the oath to observe the statutes, without
any other qualification than that he might not be obliged to attend
personally at the chapters, or to wear the collar, except at his own
pleasure. In placing the collar round his neck, and in conducting
him to his stall, Henry addressed him as ‘Mon fils,’ while Philip,
in return, called the King ‘Mon père,’ and these affectionate appellations
are repeated in the treaty of peace and unity between
the two countries, which was signed by Henry and Philip, while
sitting in their respective stalls, and to the maintenance of which
they were both then solemnly sworn. Previously to the offering,
Philip wished to stand before his stall, like the other knights, and
to follow the King to the altar, requesting to be allowed to do his
duty as a knight and brother of the order ought to do to the sovereign;
but Henry declined, and taking him by the left hand, the
two Kings offered together. After the ceremony, Philip invested
Henry, Prince of Wales, with the collar of the Golden Fleece,
into which order he had, it is said, been elected at Middleburgh in
the preceding year, 1506.</p>

<p>Under Henry VIII. we find the first Scottish monarch who ever
wore the Garter, namely James V. He accepted the insignia
“with princely heart and will,” but, in a formal instrument, he set
down the statutes which he would swear to observe, and he rejected
all others. Francis, King of France, Charles V., Emperor
of Germany, and Ferdinand, King of Hungary, were also
members of the order. But the <i>sovereign</i> princes elected during
this reign did not outnumber the alien knights of less degree.
When Henry was at Calais, he held a chapter, at which Marshal
Montmorency, Count de Beaumont, and Philip de Chabot, Count
de Neublanc, were elected into the order. This occasion was the
first and only time that the Kings of England and France attended
together and voted as companions in the chapters of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
respective orders. Like the other knights, Francis nominated for
election into the Garter, three earls or persons of higher degree,
three barons, and three knights-bachelors, and the names present
an interesting fact, which has not been generally noticed. Henry
was then enamored of Anne Boleyn, whom he had recently
created Marchioness of Pembroke, and who accompanied him to
Calais. With a solitary exception, the French King gave all his
suffrages for his own countrymen, and as the exception was in
favor of her brother, George, Lord Rochford, it was evidently intended
as a compliment to the future Queen of England.</p>

<p>It was the intention of Edward VI. to have created Lewis,
Marquis of Gonzaga, a knight of the order, but there is no evidence
that he was elected. It is difficult to ascertain the exact course of
things during this reign; for Mary, subsequently, abrogated all the
changes made by Edward, in order to adopt the statutes to the exigencies
of the reformed religion. She did even more than this;
she caused the register to be defaced, by erasing every insertion
which was not in accordance with the Romish faith. It is known,
however, that Henri II. of France was elected. His investiture
took place in a bed-room of the Louvre in Paris. He rewarded
the Garter King-at-arms with a gold chain worth two hundred
pounds, and his own royal robe, ornmented with “aglets,” and
worth twenty-five pounds. Against this one sovereign prince we
have to set the person of an alien knight—the Constable of
France. The foreign royal names on the list were, however, on
the accession of Mary, three against one of foreign knights of lower
degree. That of Philip of Spain soon made the foreign royal majority
still greater; and this majority may be said to have been
further increased by the election of the sovereign Duke of Savoy.
Mary elected no foreign knight beneath the degree of sovereign
ruler—whether king or duke.</p>

<p>Elizabeth very closely followed the same principle. Her foreign
knights were sovereigns, or about to become so. The first was
Adolphus, Duke of Holstein, son of the King of Denmark, and
heir of Norway. The second was Charles IX. of France, and the
third, Frederick, King of Denmark; the Emperor Rudolf was,
perhaps, a fourth; and the fifth, Henri Quatre, the last king of
France who wore the Garter till the accession of Louis XVIII.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
As for the Spanish widower of Mary, Sir Harris Nicholas observes,
“Philip, king of Spain, is said to have returned the Garter
by the hands of the Queen’s ambassador, Viscount Montague, who
had been sent to induce him to renew the alliance between England
and Burgundy. Philip did not conceal his regret at the change
which had taken place in the religion and policy of his country;
but he displayed no sectarian bitterness, expresses himself still desirous
of opposing the designs of the French, who sought to have
Elizabeth excommunicated, and stated that he had taken measures
to prevent this in the eyes of a son of the Church of Rome, the
greatest of all calamities, from befalling her, without her own consent.
It appears, however, that Elizabeth did not accept of Philip’s
resignation of the Garter, for he continued a companion until his
decease, notwithstanding the war between England and Spain, and
the attempt to invade this country by the Spanish Armada in
1588.”</p>

<p>When I say Elizabeth closely followed the example of Mary
I should add as an instance wherein she departed therefrom—the
election of Francis Duke of Montmorency, envoy from the French
King. The Queen bestowed this honor on the Duke, “in grateful
commemoration,” says Camden, “of the love which Anne, constable
of France, his father, bore unto her.” At the accession of
James I., however, Henri IV. of France was the only foreigner,
sovereign or otherwise, who wore the order of the Garter. Those
added by James were the King of Denmark, the Prince of Orange,
and the Prince Palatine. Of the latter I have spoken in another
place; I will only notice further here, that under James, all precedence
of stalls was taken away from princes below a certain
rank; that is to say, the last knights elected, even the King’s own
son, must take the last stall. It was also then declared “that all
princes, not absolute, should be installed, henceforth, in the puisne
place.”</p>

<p>There was <i>one</i> foreign knight, however, whose installation deserves
a word apart, for it was marked by unusual splendor, considering
how very small a potentate was the recipient of the honor.
This was Christian, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. On the
last day of the year 1624, James, with his own hands, placed the
riband and George round the neck of the Duke. The latter was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
then twenty-four years of age. “The Duke of Brunswick,” says
Chamberlain, in a letter to Sir Dudley Carleton, January 8, 1625,
“can not complain of his entertainment, which was every way
complete, very good and gracious words from the King, with the
honor of the Garter, and a pension of two thousand pounds a
year. The Prince lodged him in his own lodgings, and at parting,
gave him three thousand pounds in gold, besides other presents.”
James conferred the Garter on no less than seven of his Scottish
subjects. If these may be reckoned now, what they were considered
then, as mere foreigners, the alien knights will again outnumber
the foreign sovereign princes, wearers of the Garter.</p>

<p>The first knight invested by Charles I. was an alien chevalier,
of only noble degree. This was the Duke de Chevreuse, who
was Charles’s proxy at his nuptials with Henrietta Maria, and who
thus easily won the honors of chivalry among the Companions of
St. George. It seems, however, that the honor in question was
generally won by foreigners, because of their being engaged in
furthering royal marriages. Thus, when the King’s agent in
Switzerland, Mr. Fleming, in the year 1633, suggested to the government
that the Duke of Rohan should be elected a knight of the
Garter, Mr. Secretary Coke made reply that “The proposition
hath this inconvenience, that the rites of that ancient order comport
not with innovation, and no precedent can be found of any foreign
subject ever admitted into it, if he were not employed in an inter-marriage
with this crown, as the Duke of Chevreuse lately was.”
There certainly was not a word of truth in what the Secretary Coke
thus deliberately stated. Not only had the Garter frequently been
conferred on foreign subjects who had had nothing to do as matrimonial
agents between sovereign lovers, but only twelve years after
Coke thus wrote, Charles conferred the order upon the Duke
d’Espernon, who had no claim to it founded upon such service as
is noticed by the learned secretary.</p>

<p>At the death of Charles I. there was not, strictly speaking, a
single foreign sovereign prince belonging to the order. The three
foreign princes, Rupert, William of Orange, and the Elector Palatine,
can not justly be called so. The other foreign knights were
the Dukes of Chevreuse and Espernon.</p>

<p>The foreign knights of the order created by Charles II. were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
Prince Edward, son of “Elizabeth of Bohemia;” Prince Maurice,
his elder brother; Henry, eldest son of the Duke de Thouas,
William of Nassau, then three years of age, and subsequently our
William III.; Frederick, Elector of Brandenburg; Gaspar,
Count de Morchin; Christian, Prince Royal of Denmark; Charles
XI., King of Sweden; George, Elector of Saxony; and Prince
George of Denmark, husband of the Princess Anne. It will be
seen that those who could be strictly called “sovereign princes,”
claiming allegiance and owing none, do not outnumber alien
knights who were expected to render obedience, and could not
sovereignly exert it. Denmark and Sweden, it may be observed,
quarrelled about precedency of stalls with as much bitterness as if
they had been burghers of the “Krähwinkel” of Kotzebue.</p>

<p>The short reign of James II. presents us with only one alien
Knight of the Garter, namely, Louis de Duras, created also Earl
of Feversham. “Il était le second de son nom,” says the Biographie
Universelle, “qui eut été honoré de cette decoration, remarque
particulière dans la noblesse Française.”</p>

<p>The great Duke of Schomberg, that admirable warrior given
to England by the tyranny of Louis XIV., was the first person
invested with the Garter by William III. The other foreign
knights invested by him were the first King of Prussia, William
Duke of Zell, the Elector of Saxony, William Bentinck (Earl
of Portland), Von Keppel (Earl of Albemarle), and George of
Hanover (our George I.) Here the alien knights, not of sovereign
degree, again outnumbered those who <i>were</i> of that degree.
The Elector of Saxony refused to join William against France,
unless the Garter were first conferred on him.</p>

<p>Anne conferred the Garter on Meinhardt Schomberg, Duke of
Leinster, son of the great Schomberg; and also on George Augustus
of Hanover (subsequently George II. of England). Anne
intimated to George Louis, the father of George Augustus, that,
being a Knight of the Garter, he might very appropriately invest
his own son. George Louis, however, hated that son, and would
have nothing to do with conferring any dignity upon him. He
left it with the commissioners, Halifax and Vanbrugh, to act as
they pleased. They performed their vicarious office as they best
could, and that was only with “maimed rights.” George Louis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
with his ordinary spiteful meanness, ordered the ceremony to be
cut short of all display. He would not even permit his son to be
invested with the habit, under a canopy as was usual, and as had
been done in his own case; all that he would grant was an ordinary
arm-chair, whereon the electoral prince might sit in state,
if he chose, or was able to do so! These were the only foreigners
upon whom Anne conferred the Garter; an order which she
granted willingly to very few persons indeed.</p>

<p>“It is remarkable,” says Nicolas, “that the order was not conferred
by Queen Anne upon the Emperor, nor upon any of the
other sovereigns with whom she was for many years confederated
against France. Nor did her Majesty bestow it upon King
Charles III. of Spain, who arrived in England in September,
1703, nor upon Prince Eugene (though, when she presented him
with a sword worth five thousand pounds sterling on taking his
leave in March, 1712 there were seven vacant ribands), nor any
other of the great commanders of the allied armies who, under
the Duke of Marlborough, gained those splendid victories that
rendered her reign one of the most glorious in the annals of this
country.”</p>

<p>George I. had more regard for his grandson than for his son;
and he made Frederick (subsequently father of George III.) a
Companion of the Order, when he was not more than nine years
of age. He raised to the same honor his own brother, Prince
Ernest Augustus, and invested both knights at a Chapter held in
Hanover in 1711. With this family exception, the Order of the
Garter was not conferred upon any foreign prince in the reign of
George I.</p>

<p>George II. gave the Garter to that deformed Prince of Orange
who married his excitable daughter Anne. The same honor was
conferred on Prince Frederick of Hesse Cassel, who espoused
George’s amiable daughter Mary; Prince Frederick of Saxe
Gotha, the Duke of Saxe Weisenfels, the Margrave of Anspach,
the fatherless son of the Prince of Orange last named, and, worthiest
of all, that Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick who won the
honor by gaining the battle of Minden. He was invested with
cap, habit, and decorations, in front of his tent and in the face of
his whole army. His gallant enemy, De Broglie, to do honor to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
the new knight, proclaimed a suspension of arms for the day, drew
up his own troops where they could witness the spectacle of courage
and skill receiving their reward, and with his principal officers
dining with the Prince in the evening. “Each party,” says Miss
Banks, “returned at night to his army, in order to recommence
the hostilities they were engaged in, by order of their respective
nations, against each other, on the next rising of the sun.” I do
not know what this anecdote most proves—the cruel absurdity
of war, or the true chivalry of warriors.</p>

<p>The era of George III. was indeed that in which foreign princes,
sovereign and something less than that, abounded in the order.
The first who received the Garter was the brother of Queen
Charlotte, the reigning Duke of Mecklenburg Strelitz. Then
came the Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, who married Augusta,
the sister of George III. Caroline of Brunswick was the issue
of this marriage. Of the kings, <i>roitelets</i>, and petty princes of
Germany who were added to the Garter, or rather, had the Garter
added to them, it is not worth while speaking; but there is an
incident connected with the foreign knights which <i>does</i> merit to be
preserved. When Bonaparte founded the Legion of Honor, he
prevailed on the King of Prussia (willing to take anything for
his own, and reluctant to sacrifice anything for the public good)
to accept the cross of the Legion for himself, and several others
assigned to him for distribution. The king rendered himself justly
abhorred for this disgraceful act; but he found small German
princes quite as eager as he was to wear the badge of the then
enemy of Europe. A noble exception presented itself in the
person of the Duke of Brunswick, a Knight of the Garter, to
whom the wretched king sent the insignia of the French order in
1805. The duke, in a letter to the king, refused to accept such
honor, “because, in his quality of Knight of the most noble Order
of the Garter, he was prevented from receiving any badge of
chivalry instituted by a person at war with the sovereign of that
order.” The Prussian king found an easier conscience in the
Prince of Hesse Cassel, who was also a Knight of the Garter.
This individual, mean and double-faced as the king, wore the cross
of the Legion of Honor with the Garter. At <i>that</i> troubled period,
it was exactly as if some nervous lairds, in the days of Highland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
feuds, had worn, at the same time, the plaids of the Macdonalds
and Campbells, in order to save their skins and estates by
thus pretending to be members of two hostile parties.</p>

<p>Under the Regency of George IV., the foreign sovereign princes
were admitted into the order without any regard whatever to the
regulations by statute. Within one year, or very little more than
that period, two emperors, three kings, and an heir to a throne,
who soon after came to his inheritance, were enrolled Companions
of the order. But it was the era of victories and rejoicings, and
no one thought of objecting to a prodigality which would have astounded
the royal founder. Long after the period of victory, however,
the same liberality continued to be evinced toward foreign
princes of sovereign degree. Thus at the accession of Charles
X., the England monarch despatched the Duke of Northumberland
as Embassador Extraordinary to attend at the coronation of
the French monarch, and to invest him, subsequently, with the
Order of the Garter. I remember seeing the English procession
pass from the duke’s residence in the Rue du Bac, over the Pont
Royal to the Tuileries. It puzzled the French people extremely.
It took place on Tuesday, June 7, 1825. At noon, “four of the
royal carriages,” says the Galignani of the period, “drawn by
eight horses, in which were the Baron de Lalivre and M. de Viviers,
were sent to the Hotel Galifet for the Duke of Northumberland.”
The two envoys who thus contrived to ride in four carriages
and eight horses—a more wonderful feat than was ever
accomplished by Mr. Ducrow—having reached the ducal hotel,
were received by the duke, Lord Granville, our ordinary embassador,
and Sir George Naylor, his Britannic Majesty’s Commissioners
charged to invest the King of France with the insignia of
the Garter. The procession then set out; and, as I have said, it
perplexed the French spectators extremely. They could not
imagine that so much ceremony was necessary in order to put a
garter round a leg, and hang a collar from a royal neck. Besides
the four French carriages-and-eight, there were three of the
duke’s carriages drawn by six horses; one carriage of similar
state, and two others more modestly drawn by pairs, belonging to
Lord Granville. The carriage of “Garter” himself, behind a
couple of ordinary steeds; and eight other carriages, containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
the suites of the embassadors, or privileged persons who passed
for such in order to share in the spectacle, closed the procession.
The duke had a very noble gathering around him, namely, the
Hon. Algernon Percy, his secretary, the Marquis of Caermarthen,
the Earl of Hopetoun, Lords Prudhoe (the present duke), Strathaven,
Pelham, and Hervey, the Hon. Charles Percy, and the
goodhumored-looking Archdeacon Singleton. Such was the <i>entourage</i>
of the embassador extraordinary. The ordinary embassador,
Lord Granville, was somewhat less nobly surrounded. He
had with him the Hon. Mr. Bligh, and Messrs. Mandeville, Gore,
Abercrombie, and Jones. Sir George Naylor, in his Tabard, was
accompanied by a cloud of heralds, some of whom have since become
kings-of-arms—namely, Messrs. Woods, Young, and Wollaston,
and his secretary, Mr. Howard. More noticeable men
followed in the train. There were Earl Gower and Lord Burghersh,
the “Honorables” Mr. Townshend, Howard, and Clive,
Captain Buller, and two men more remarkable than all the rest—the
two embassadors included—namely, Sir John Malcolm and
Sir Sidney Smith. Between admiring spectators, who were profoundly
amazed at the sight of the duke in his robes, the procession
arrived at the palace, where, after a pause and a reorganizing in
the Hall of Embassadors, the party proceeded in great state into
the Gallery of Diana. Here a throne had been especially erected
for the investiture, and the show was undoubtedly most splendid.
Charles X. looked in possession of admirable health and spirits—of
everything, indeed, but bright intellect. He was magnificently
surrounded. The duke wore with his robes that famous diamond-hilted
sword which had been presented to him by George IV., and
which cost, I forget how many thousand pounds. His heron’s
plume alone was said to be worth five hundred guineas. His
superb mantle of blue velvet, embroidered with gold, was supported
by his youthful nephew, George Murray (the present Duke of
Athol), dressed in a Hussar uniform, and the Hon. James Drummond,
in a Highland suit. Seven gentlemen had the responsible
mission of carrying the insignia on cushions, and Sir George preceded
them, bearing a truncheon, as “Garter Principal King-at-arms.”
The duke recited an appropriate address, giving a concise
history of the order, and congratulating himself on having been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
employed on the present honorable mission. The investiture took
place with the usual ceremonies; but I remember that there was
no salute of artillery, as was enjoined in the book of instructions
drawn up by Garter. The latter official performed his office most
gracefully, and attached to the person of the King of France, that
day, pearls worth a million of francs. The royal knight made a
very pleasant speech when all was concluded, and the usual hospitality
followed the magnificent labors of an hour and a half’s
continuance.</p>

<p>On the following evening, the Duke gave a splendid <i>fête</i> at his
hotel, in honor of the coronation of Charles X., and of his admission
into the Order of the Garter. The King and Queen of Wurtemburg
were present, with some fifteen hundred persons of less rank,
but many of whom were of greater importance in society. Perhaps
not the least remarkable feature of the evening was the presence
together, in one group, of the Dauphin and that Duchess of
Angoulême who was popularly known as the “orphan girl of the
Temple,” with the Duchess of Berri, the Duke of Orleans (Louis
Philippe), and Talleyrand. The last-named still wore the long
bolster-cravat, of the time of the Revolution, and looked as cunning
as though he knew the destiny that awaited the entire group, three
of whom have since died in exile—he alone breathing his last
sigh, in calm tranquillity, in his own land.</p>

<p>Charles X. conferred on the ducal bearer of the insignia of the
Garter a splendid gift—one of the finest and most costly vases
ever produced at the royal manufacture of Porcelain at Sèvres.
The painting on it, representing the Tribunal of Diana, is the
work of M. Leguai, and it occupied that distinguished artist full
three years before it was completed. Considering its vast dimensions,
the nature of the painting, and its having passed twice
through the fire without the slightest alteration, it is unique of its
kind. This colossal vase now stands in the centre of the ball-room
in Northumberland House.</p>

<p>The last monarch to whom a commission has carried the insignia
of the Garter, was the Czar Nicholas. It was characteristic of the
man that, courteous as he was to the commissioners, he would not,
as was customary in such cases, dine with them. They were entertained,
however, according to his orders, by other members of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
his family. It is since the reign of George III. that Mr. Macaulay’s
remark touching the fact of the Garter being rarely conferred
on aliens, except sovereign princes, may be said to be well-founded.
No alien, under princely rank, now wears the Garter. The most
illustrious of the foreign knights are the two who were last created
by patent, namely, the Emperor Louis Napoleon and the King of
Sardinia. The King of Prussia is also a knight of the order, and,
as such, he is bound by his oath never to act against the sovereign
of that order; but in our struggle with felonious Russia, the Prussian
government, affecting to be neutral, imprisons an English
consul on pretence that the latter has sought to enlist natives of
Prussia into the English service, while, on the other hand, it passes
over to Russia the material for making war, and sanctions the
raising of a Russian loan in Berlin, to be devoted, as far as possible,
to the injury of England. The King is but a poor knight!—and,
by the way, that reminds me that the once so-called poor

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c12">THE POOR KNIGHTS OF WINDSOR,</h2>
<p class="c sp less">AND THEIR DOINGS.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> founder of the Order of the Garter did well when he
thought of the “Milites pauperes,” and having created a fraternity
for wealthy and noble cavaliers, created one also for the same
number of “poor knights, infirm of body, indigent and decayed,”
who should be maintained for the honor of God and St. George,
continually serve God in their devotions, and have no further
heavy duty, after the days of bustle and battle, than to pray for
the prosperity of all living knights of the Garter, and for the repose
of the souls of all those who were dead. It was resolved that
none but really poor knights should belong to the fraternity,
whether named, as was their privilege, by a companion of the
noble order, or by the sovereign, as came at last to be exclusively
the case. If a poor knight had the misfortune to become the possessor
of property of any sort realizing twenty pounds per annum,
he became at once disqualified for companionship. Even in very
early times, his position, with house, board, and various aids, spiritual
and bodily, was worth more than this.</p>

<p>To be an alms knight, as Ashmole calls each member, implied
no degradation whatever; quite the contrary. Each poor but
worthy gentleman was placed on a level with the residentiary
canons of Windsor. Like these, they received twelvepence each,
every day that they attended service in the chapel, or abode in the
College, with a honorarium of forty shillings annually for small
necessaries. Their daily presence at chapel was compulsory, except
good and lawful reason could be shown for the contrary. The
old knights were not only required to be at service, but at high
mass, the masses of the Virgin Mary, as also at Vespers and
Complins—from the beginning to the end. They earned their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
twelvepence honestly, but nevertheless the ecclesiastical corporation
charged with the payment, often did what such corporations,
of course, have never tried to do since the Reformation—namely,
cheat those who ought to have been recipients of their due. Dire
were the discussions between the poor (and pertinacious) knights,
and the dean, canons, and treasurers of the College. It required
a mitred Archbishop of York and Lord Chancellor of England to
settle the dispute, and a very high opinion does it afford us of the
good practical sense of Church and Chancery in the days of Henry
VI., when we find that the eminent individual with the double office
not only came to a happy conclusion rapidly, and ordered all arrears
to be paid to the poor knights, but decreed that the income
of the treasurer should be altogether stopped, until full satisfaction
was rendered to the “milites pauper.” For the sake of such
Chancery practice one would almost consent to take the Church
with it.</p>

<p>But not only did the lesser officials of that Church cheat the
veteran knights of their pay, but their itching palm inflicted other
wrong. It was the fitting custom to divide the fines, levied upon
absentees from public worship, among the more habitually devout
brethren. Gradually, however, the dean and canons appropriated
these moneys to themselves, so that the less godly the knights
were, the richer were the dean and canons. Further, many dying
noblemen had bequeathed very valuable legacies to the College
and poor fraternity of veterans. These the business-like
ecclesiastics had devoted to their own entire profit; and it required
stringent command from king and bishop, in the reign of Richard
II., before they would admit the military legatees even to a share
in the bequest.</p>

<p>Not, indeed, that the stout old veterans were always blameless.
Good living and few cares made “fast men” of some of them.
There were especially two in the reign last named, who created
very considerable scandal. These were a certain Sir Thomas
Tawne and Sir John Breton. They were married men, but the
foolish old fellows performed homage to vessels of iniquity, placed
by them on the domestic altar. In other words, they were by far
too civil to a couple of hussies with red faces and short kirtles,
and <i>that</i>—not that such circumstance rendered the matter worse—before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
the eyes of their faithful and legitimate wives. The bishop
was horror-stricken, no doubt, and the exemplary ecclesiastics of
the College were enjoined to remonstrate, reprove, and, if amendment
did not follow, to expel the offenders.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas, I presume, heeded the remonstrance and submitted
to live more decorously, for nothing more is said of him. Jolly
Sir John was more difficult to deal with. He too may have dismissed
Cicely and made his peace with poor Lady Breton, but
the rollicking old knight kept the College in an uproar, nevertheless.
He resumed attendance at chapel, indeed, but he did this
after a fashion of his own. He would walk slowly in the procession
of red-mantled brethren on their way to service, so as to
obstruct those who were in the rear, or he would walk in a ridiculous
manner, so as to rouse unseemly laughter. I am afraid that
old Sir John was a very sad dog, and, however the other old
gentleman may have behaved, he was really a godless fellow.
Witness the fact that, on getting into chapel, when he retired to
pray, he forthwith fell asleep, and could, or would, hardly keep his
eyes open, even at the sacrament at the altar.</p>

<p>After all, there was a gayer old fellow than Sir John Breton
among the poor knights. One Sir Emanuel Cloue is spoken of
who appears to have been a very Don Giovanni among the silly
maids and merry wives of Windsor. He was for ever with his
eye on a petticoat and his hand on a tankard; and what with love
and spiced canary, he could never sit still at mass, but was addicted
to running about among the congregation. It would puzzle
St. George himself to tell all the nonsense he talked on these
occasions.</p>

<p>When we read how the bishop suggested that the King and
Council should discover a remedy to check the rollicking career
of Sir Edmund, we are at first perplexed to make out why the
cure was not assigned to the religious officials. The fact, however,
is that they were as bad as, or worse than, the knights.
They too were as often to be detected with their lips on the brim
of a goblet, or on the cheek of a damsel. There was Canon
Lorying. He was addicted to hawking, hunting, and jollification;
and the threat of dismissal, without chance of reinstalment, was
had recourse to, before the canon ceased to make breaches in decorum.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
The vicars were as bad as the canons. The qualifications
ascribed to them of being “inflated and wanton,” sufficiently
describe by what sins these very reverend gentlemen were
beset. They showed no reverence for the frolicsome canons, as
might have been expected; and if both parties united in exhibiting
as little veneration for the dean, the reason, doubtless, lay
in the circumstance that the dean, as the bishop remarked, was
remiss, simple, and negligent, himself. He was worse than this.
He not only allowed the documents connected with the Order to
go to decay, or be lost, but he would not pay the vicars their salaries
till he was compelled to do so by high authority. The dean,
in short, was a sorry knave; he even embezzled the fees paid
when a vicar occupied a new stall, and which were intended to be
appropriated to the general profit of the chapter, and pocketed the
entire proceeds for his own personal profit and enjoyment. The
canons again made short work of prayers and masses, devoting
only an hour each day for the whole. This arrangement may not
have displeased the more devout among the knights; and the
canons defied the bishop to point out anything in the statutes by
which they were prevented from effecting this abbreviation of their
service, and earning their shilling easily. Of this ecclesiastical
irregularity the bishop, curiously enough, solicited the state to
pronounce its condemnation; and an order from King and Council
was deemed a good remedy for priests of loose thoughts and practices.
A matter of more moment was submitted to the jurisdiction
of meaner authority. Thus, when one of the vicars, John
Chichester, was “scandalized respecting the wife of Thomas
Swift” (which is a very pretty way of putting his offence), the
matter was left to the correction of the dean, who was himself
censurable, if not under censure—for remissness, negligence,
stupidity, and fraud. The dean’s frauds were carried on to that
extent that a legacy of £200 made to the brotherhood of poor
knights, having come to the decanal hands, and the dean not
having accounted for the same, compulsion was put on him to render
such account; and <i>that</i> appears to be all the penalty he ever
paid for his knavery. Where the priests were of such kidney,
we need not wonder that the knights observed in the dirty and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
much-encumbered cloisters, the licentiousness which was once common
to men in the camp.</p>

<p>Churchmen and knights went on in their old courses, notwithstanding
the interference of inquisitors. Alterations were made
in the statutes, to meet the evil; some knights solicited incorporation
among themselves, separate from the Church authorities; but
this and other remedies were vainly applied.</p>

<p>In the reign of Henry VIII. the resident knights were not all
military men. Some of them were eminent persons, who, it is
thought, withdrew from the world and joined the brotherhood, out
of devotion. Thus there was Sir Robert Champlayne, who had
been a right lusty knight, indeed, and who proved himself so again,
after he returned once more to active life. Among the laymen,
admitted to be poor knights, were Hulme, formerly Clarencieux
King-at-arms; Carly, the King’s physician: Mewtes, the King’s
secretary for the French language; and Westley, who was made
second baron of the Exchequer in 1509.</p>

<p>The order appears to have fallen into hopeless confusion, but
Henry VIII., who performed many good acts, notwithstanding his
evil deeds and propensities, bequeathed lands, the profits whereof
(£600) were to be employed in the maintenance of “Thirteen
Poor Knights.” Each was to have a shilling a day, and their
governor, three pounds, six and eightpence, additional yearly.
Houses were built for these knights on the south side of the lower
ward of the castle, where they are still situated, at a cost of nearly
£3000. A white cloth-gown and a red cloth-mantle, appropriately
decorated, were also assigned to each knight. King James doubled
the pecuniary allowance, and made it payable in the Exchequer,
quarterly.</p>

<p>Charles I. intended to increase the number of knights to their
original complement. He did not proceed beyond the intention.
Two of his subjects, however, themselves knights, Sir Peter La
Maire and Sir Francis Crane, left lands which supplied funds for
the support of five additional knights.</p>

<p>Cromwell took especial care that no knight should reside at
Windsor, who was hostile to his government; and he was as careful
that no preacher should hold forth there, who was not more
friendly to the commonwealth than to monarchy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>At this period, and for a hundred years before this, there was
not a man of real knight’s degree belonging to the order, nor has
there since been down to the present time. In 1724 the benevolent
Mr. Travers bequeathed property to be applied to the maintenance
of Seven Naval Knights. It is scarcely credible, but it is
the fact, that seventy years elapsed before our law, which then
hung a poor wretch for robbing to the amount of forty shillings, let
loose the funds to be appropriated according to the will of the testator,
and under sanction of the sovereign. What counsellors and
attorneys fattened upon the costs, meantime, it is not now of importance
to inquire. In 1796, thirteen superannuated or disabled
lieutenants of men-of-war, officers of that rank being alone eligible
under Mr. Travers’s will, were duly provided for. The naval
knights, all unmarried, have residences and sixty pounds per annum
each, in addition to their half-pay. The sum of ten shillings,
weekly, is deducted from the “several allowances, to keep a constant
table.”</p>

<p>The Military and Naval Knights—for the term “Poor” was
dropped, by order of William IV.—no longer wear the mantle, as
in former times; but costumes significant of their profession and
their rank therein. There are twenty-five of them, one less than
their original number, and they live in harmony with each other
and the Church. The ecclesiastical corporation has nothing to do
with their funds, and these unmarried naval knights do not disturb
the slumbers of a single Mr. Brook within the liberty of Windsor.</p>

<p>In concluding this division, let me add a word touching the</p>


<p class="c">KNIGHTS OF THE BATH.</p>

<p>There was no more gallant cavalier in his day than Geoffrey,
Earl of Anjou. He was as meek as he was gallant. In testimony
of his humility he assumed a sprig of the broom plant (planta
genista) for his device, and thereby he gave the name of Plantagenet
to the long and illustrious line.</p>

<p>If his bravery raised him in the esteem of women, his softness
of spirit earned for him some ridicule. Matilda, the “imperially
perverse,” laughed outright when her sire proposed she should accept
the hand of Geoffrey of Anjou. “He is so like a girl,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
Matilda. “There is not a more lion-hearted knight in all Christendom,”
replied the king. “There is none certainly so sheep-faced,”
retorted the arrogant heiress; she then reluctantly consented
to descend to be mate of the wearer of the broom.</p>

<p>Matilda threw as many obstacles as she could in the way of the
completion of the nuptial ceremony. At last this solemn matter
was definitively settled to come off at Rouen, on the 26th of August,
1127. Geoffrey must have been a knight before his marriage
with Matilda. However this may be, he is said to have been created
an English knight in honor of the occasion. To show how
he esteemed the double dignity of knight and husband, he prepared
himself for both, by first taking a bath, and afterward putting on a
clean linen shirt. Chroniclers assure us that this is the first instance,
since the Normans came into England, in which bathing is
mentioned in connection with knighthood. Over his linen shirt
Geoffrey wore a gold-embroidered garment, and above all a purple
mantle. We are told too that he wore silk stockings, an article
which is supposed to have been unknown in England until a much
later period. His feet were thrust into a gay pair of slippers, on
the outside of each of which was worked a golden lion. In this
guise he was wedded to Matilda, and never had household lord a
greater virago for a lady.</p>

<p>From this circumstance the Knights of the Bath are said to have
had their origin. For a considerable period, this order of chivalry
ranked as the highest military order in Europe. All the members
were companions. There was but one chief, and no knight ranked
higher, nor lower, than any other brother of the society. The
order, nevertheless, gradually became obsolete. Vacancies had
not been filled up; that Garter had superseded the Bath, and it
was not till the reign of George II. that the almost extinct fraternity
was renewed.</p>

<p>Its revival took place for political reasons, and these are well
detailed by Horace Walpole, in his “Reminiscences of the Courts
of George the First and Second.” “It was the measure,” he says,
“of Sir Robert Walpole, and was an artful bunch of thirty-six ribands,
to supply a fund of favors, in lieu of places. He meant, too,
to stave off the demand for garters, and intended that the red
should have been a stage to the blue; and accordingly took one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
of the former himself. He offered the new order to old Sarah,
Duchess of Marlborough, for her grandson the Duke, and for the
Duke of Bedford, who had married one of her granddaughters.
She haughtily replied, that they should take nothing but the Garter.
‘Madam,’ said Sir Robert, coolly, ‘they who take the Bath
will the sooner have the Garter.’ The next year he took the latter
himself, with the Duke of Richmond, both having been previously
installed knights of the revived institution.”</p>

<p>Sir Robert respected the forms and laws of the old institution,
and these continued to be observed down to the period following
the battle of Waterloo. Instead of their creating a new order for
the purpose of rewarding the claimants for distinction, it was resolved
to enlarge that of the Bath, which was, therefore, divided
into three classes.</p>

<p>First, there was the Grand Cross of the Bath (G. C. B.), the
reward of military and diplomatic services.</p>

<p>The second class, of Knights Commanders (C. B.), was open to
those meritorious persons who had the good luck to hold commissions
not below the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel or Post-Captain.
The members of this class rank above the ordinary knights-bachelors.</p>

<p>The third class, of Knights Companions, was instituted for officers
holding inferior commissions to those named above, and whose
services in their country’s cause rendered them eligible for admission.</p>

<p>These arrangements have been somewhat modified subsequently,
and not without reason. Henry VIIth’s Chapel in Westminster
Abbey is the locality in which the installation of the different
knights takes place. The statutes of the order authorize the degradation
of a knight “convicted of heresy against the Articles of
the Christian religion;” or who has been “attainted of high treason,”
or of “cowardly flying from some field of battle.” It is
rather curious that felony is not made a ground of degradation.
The Duke of Ormond was the last Knight of the Garter who was
degraded, for treason against George I. Addison, after the degradation,
invariably speaks of him as “the late Duke.” A more
grievous offender than he was that Earl of Somerset, who had
been a reckless page, and who was an unworthy Knight of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
Garter, under James I. He was convicted of murder, but he was
not executed, and to the day of his death he continued to wear the
Garter, of which he had been pronounced unworthy. The last
instances of degradation from the Order of the Bath were those of
Lord Cochrane (in 1814), for an alleged misdemeanor, and Sir
Eyre Coote, two years subsequently. In these cases the popular
judgment did not sanction the harsh measures adopted by those in
authority.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Subsequently, the Prince Regent ordered the name of Captain Hanchett
to be erased from the roll of the Bath, he having been struck off the list of
Captains in the Royal Navy.</p>

</div>


<p>In olden times, the new Knights of the Bath made as gallant
display in public as the Knights of the Garter. In reference to
this matter, Mr. Mackenzie Walcott, in his “Westminster,” cites
a passage from an author whom he does not name. The reverend
gentleman says: “On Sunday, July 24th, 1603, was performed
the solemnity of Knights of the Bath riding honorably from St.
James’s to the Court, and made show with their squires and pages
about the Tilt-yard, and after went into the park of St. James, and
there lighted from their horses and went up into the King’s Majesty’s
presence, in the gallery, where they received the order of
Knighthood of the Bath.”</p>

<p>The present “Horse-Guards” occupies a portion of the old Tilt-yard;
but for the knightly doings there, and also in Smithfield, I
must refer all curious readers to Mr. Charles Knight’s “Pictorial
History of London.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">The Order of the Thistle</span>, if Scottish antiquaries may be
credited, is almost as ancient as the times in which the first thistle
was nibbled at by the primitive wild-ass. Very little, however, is
known upon the subject, and that little is not worth repeating.
The earliest certain knowledge dates from Robert II., whose coins
bore the impress of St. Andrew and his cross. James III. is the
first monarch who is known to have worn the thistle, as his badge.
There is no evidence of these emblems being connected with
knighthood until the reign of James V. The Reformers, subsequently,
suppressed the chivalric order, as popish, and it was not
till the reign of James II. of England that the thistle and chivalry
again bloomed together. The order is accessible only to peers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>A commoner may have conferred more honor and service on his
country than all the Scottish peers put together, but no amount
of merit could procure him admission into the Order of the
Thistle. Nevertheless three commoners <i>did</i> once belong to it;
but their peculiar merit was that they were heirs presumptive to
dukedoms.</p>

<p>Ireland was left without an order until the year 1783, when
George III. good-naturedly established that of St. Patrick, to the
great delight of many who desired to be knights, and to the infinite
disgust of all who were disappointed. Except in name and
local circumstances there is nothing that distinguishes it from other
orders.</p>

<p>I must not conclude this section without remarking, that shortly
after the sovereignty of Malta and the Ionian Isles was ceded to
Great Britain, the Order of St. Michael was instituted in 1818,
for the Purpose of having what Walpole calls “a fund of ribands,”
to reward those native gentlemen who had deserved or desired
favors, if not places.</p>

<p>The Order of the Guelphs was founded by the Prince Regent
in 1815. George III. had designed such an order for the most
distinguished of his Hanoverian subjects. Down to the period of
the accession of Queen Victoria, however, the order was conferred
on a greater number of Englishmen than of natives of Hanover.
Since the latter Kingdom has passed under the rule of the male
heir of the line of Brunswick, the order of Guelph has become a
foreign order. Licenses to accept this or any other foreign order
does not authorize the assumption of any style, appellation, rank,
precedence, or privilege appertaining unto a knight-bachelor of
these realms. Such is the law as laid down by a decision of Lord
Ellenborough, and which does not agree with the judgment of
Coke.</p>

<p>The history of foreign orders would occupy too much of my
space; but there is something so amusing in the history of an order
of knights called “Knights of the Holy Ampoule,” that a few
words on the subject may not be unacceptable to such readers as
are unacquainted with the ephemeral cavaliers in question.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c13">THE KNIGHTS OF THE “SAINTE AMPOULE.”</h2>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Mais ce sont des chevaliers pour rire.”— <i>Le Sage.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap large">There</span> have been knights who, like “special constables,” have
been created merely “for the nonce;” and who have been as
ephemeral as the shortlived flies so called. This was especially
the case with the Knights of the Holy “Ampoule,” or anointing
oil, used at the coronation of the kings of France.</p>

<p>This oil was said to have been brought to St. Remy (Remigius)
by a dove, from Heaven, and to have been placed by the great
converter of Clovis, in his own tomb, where it was found, by a
miraculous process. St. Remy himself never alluded either to
the oil or the story connected with it. Four centuries after the
saint’s death the matter was first spoken—nay, the oil was boldly
distilled, by Hinckmar, Archbishop of Rheims. This archi-episcopal
biographer of St. Remy has inserted wonders in the saint’s
life, which staggered, while they amused, the readers who were able
to peruse his work by fireside, in castle-hall, or convert refectory.
I can only allude to one of these wonders—namely, the “Sainte
Ampoule.” Hinckmar actually asserted that when St. Remy was
about to consecrate with oil, the humble King Clovis, at his coronation,
a dove descended from Heaven, and placed in his hands a
small vial of holy oil. Hinckmar defied any man to prove the
contrary. As he further declared that the vial of oil was still to
be found in the saint’s sepulchre, and as it was so found, accordingly,
Hinckmar was allowed to have proved his case. Thenceforward,
the chevaliers of the St. Ampoule were created, for a
day—that of the crowning of the sovereign. They had charge
of the vial, delivered it to the archbishop, and saw it restored to
its repository; and therewith, the coronation and their knightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
character concluded together. From that time, down to the period
of Louis XVI., the knights and the vial formed the most distinguished
portion of the coronation procession and doings at the
crowning of the kings of France.</p>

<p>Then ensued the Revolution; and as that mighty engine never
touched anything without smashing it, you may be sure that the
vial of St. Remy hardly escaped destruction.</p>

<p>On the 6th of October, 1793, Citizen Rhull entered the modest
apartment of Philippe Hourelle, <i>chief marguillier</i> of the Cathedral
of Rheims, and without ceremony demanded that surrender should
be made to him of the old glass-bottle of the <i>ci-devant</i> Remy. Philippe’s
wig raised itself with horror; but as Citizen Rhull told him
that it would be as easy to lift his head from his shoulders as his
wig from his head, if he did not obey, the <i>marguillier</i> stammered
out an assertion that the reliquary was in the keeping of the curé,
M. Seraine, to whom he would make instant application.</p>

<p>“Bring pomatum and all,” said Citizen Rhull, who thus profanely
misnamed the sacred balm or thickened oil, which had
anointed the head and loins of so many kings from Charles the
Bald, downward.</p>

<p>“May I ask,” said Philippe, timidly, “what you will do therewith?”</p>

<p>“Grease <i>your</i> neck, that the knife may slip the easier through
it, unless you bring it within a decade of minutes.”</p>

<p>“Too much honor by half,” exclaimed Philippe. “I will slip
to the curé as rapidly as if I slid the whole way on the precious
ointment itself. Meanwhile, here is a bottle of Burgundy—”</p>

<p>“Which I shall have finished within the time specified. So,
despatch; and let us have t’other bottle, too!”</p>

<p>When Philippe Hourelle had communicated the request to the
curé, Monsieur Seraine, with a quickness of thought that did justice
to his imagination, exclaimed, “We will take the rogues in,
and give them a false article for the real one.” But the time was
so short; there was no second ancient-looking vial at hand; there
was not a pinch of pomatum, nor a spoonful of oil in the house,
and the curé confessed, with a sigh, that the genuine relic must
needs be surrendered. “But we can save some of it!” cried M.
Seraine; “here is the vial, give me the consecrating spoon.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
And with the handle of the spoon, having extracted some small
portions, which the curé subsequently wrapped up carefully, and
rather illegibly labelled, the vial was delivered to Philippe, who
surrendered it to Citizen Rhull, who carried the same to the front
of the finest cathedral in France, and at the foot of the statue of
Louis XV. Citizen Rhull solemnly hammered the vial into powder,
and, in the name of the Republic, trod the precious ointment underfoot
till it was not to be distinguished from the mud with which
it was mingled.</p>

<p>“And so do we put an end to princes and pomatum,” cried he.</p>

<p>Philippe coughed evasively; smiled as if he was of the same
way of thinking with the republican, and exclaimed, very mentally
indeed, “Vivent les princes et la pommade.” Neither, he felt assured,
was irrevocably destroyed.</p>

<p>The time, indeed, did come round again for princes, and Napoleon
was to be crowned at Notre Dame. He cared little as to
what had become of the Heaven-descended ointment, and he
might have anointed, as well as crowned, himself. There were
some dozen gentlemen who hoped that excuse might be discovered
for creating the usual order of the Knights of the Ampoule; but
the Emperor did not care a fig for knights or ointment, and, to
the horror of all who hoped to be chevaliers, the imperial coronation
was celebrated without either. But then Napoleon was discrowned,
as was to be expected from such profanity; and therewith
returned the Bourbons, who, having forgotten nothing,
bethought themselves of the Saint Ampoule. Monsieur de
Chevrières, magistrate at Rheims, set about the double work of
discovery and recovery. For some time he was unsuccessful.
At length, early in 1819, the three sons of the late Philippe
Hourelle waited on him. They made oath that not only were
they aware of a portion of the sacred ointment having been in the
keeping of their late father, but that his widow succeeded the
inheritance, and that she reckoned it as among her choicest
treasures.</p>

<p>“She has nothing to do but to make it over to me,” said Monsieur
Chevrières; “she will be accounted of in history as the
mother of the knights of the Ampoule of the Restoration.”</p>

<p>“It is vexatious,” said the eldest son, “but the treasure has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
lost. At the time of the invasion, our house was plundered, and
the relic was the first thing the enemy laid his hands on.”</p>

<p>The disappointment that ensued was only temporary. A judge
named Lecomte soon appeared, who made oath that he had in his
keeping a certain portion of what had at first been consigned to
the widow Hourelle. The portion was so small that it required
an eye of faith, very acute and ready indeed, to discern it. The
authorities looked upon the relic, and thought if Louis XVIII.
could not be crowned till a sufficient quantity of the holy ointment
was recovered wherewith to anoint him, the coronation was not
likely to be celebrated yet awhile.</p>

<p>Then arose a crowd of priests, monks, and ex-monks, all of
whom declared that the curé, M. Seraine, had imparted to them
the secret of his having preserved a portion of the dried anointing
oil, but they were unable to say where he had deposited it. Some
months of hesitation ensued, when, in summer, M. Bouré, a priest
of Berry-au-Bac, came forward and proclaimed that he was the
depositary of the long-lost relic, and that he had preserved it in a
portion of the winding-sheet of St. Remy himself. A week later
M. Champagne Provotian appeared, and made deposition to the
following effect: He was standing near Rhull when the latter, in
October, 1793, destroyed the vial which had been brought from
Heaven by a dove, at the foot of the statue of Louis XV. When
the republican struck the vial, some fragments of the glass flew
on to the coat-sleeve of the said M. Champagne. These he dexterously
preserved, took home with him, and now produced in
court.</p>

<p>A commission examined the various relics, and the fragments
of glass. The whole was pronounced genuine, and the chairman
thought that by process of putting “that and that together,” there
was enough of legend, vial, and ointment to legitimately anoint
and satisfy any Christian king.</p>

<p>“There is nothing now to obstruct your majesty’s coronation,”
said his varlet to him one morning, after having spent three hours
in a service for which he hoped to be appointed one of the knights
of the Sainte Ampoule; “there is now absolutely nothing to prevent
that august ceremony.”</p>

<p>“Allons donc!” said Louis XVIII. with that laugh of incredulity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
that shrug of the shoulders, and that good-humored impatience
at legends and absurdities, which made the priests speak of him
as an infidel.</p>

<p>“What shall be done with the ointment?” said the knight-expectant.</p>

<p>“Lock it up in the vestry cupboard, and say no more about it.”
And this was done with some ceremony and a feeling of disappointment.
The gathered relics, placed in a silver reliquary lined
with white silk, and enclosed in a metal case under three locks,
were deposited within the tomb of St. Remy. There it remained
till Charles X. was solemnly crowned in 1825. In that year, positively
for the last time, the knights of the Sainte Ampoule were
solemnly created, and did their office. As soon as Charles entered
the choir, he knelt in the front of the altar. On rising, he was
led into the centre of the sanctuary, where a throned chair received
his august person. A splendid group half-encircled him; and
then approached the knights of the Sainte Ampoule in grand procession,
bearing all that was left of what the sacred dove did or
did not bring to St. Remy, for the anointing of Clovis. Not less
than three prelates, an archbishop and two bishops, received the
ointment from the hands of the knights, and carried it to the high
altar. Their excellencies and eminences may be said to have performed
their office with unction, but the people laughed alike at
the knights, the pomatum, and the ceremony, all of which combined
could not endow Charles X. with sense enough to keep his place.
The knights of the Sainte Ampoule may be said now to have lost
their occupation for ever.</p>

<p>Of all the memorabilia of Rheims, the good people there dwelt
upon none more strongly than the old and splendid procession of
these knights of the Sainte Ampoule. The coronation cortège
seemed only a subordinate point of the proceedings; and the magnificent
canopy, upheld by the knights over the vial, on its way
from the abbey of St. Remy to the cathedral, excited as much
attention as the king’s crown.</p>

<p>The proceedings, however, were not always of a peaceable
character. The Grand Prior of St. Remy was always the bearer
of the vial, in its case or shrine. It hung from his neck by a
golden chain, and he himself was mounted on a white horse. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
placing the vial in the hands of the archbishop, the latter pledged
himself by solemn oath to restore it at the conclusion of the ceremony;
and some half-dozen barons were given as hostages by way
of security. The procession back to the abbey, through the gayly
tapestried streets, was of equal splendor with that to the cathedral.</p>

<p>The horse on which the Grand Prior was mounted was furnished
by the government, but the Prior claimed it as the property
of the abbey as soon as he returned thither. This claim was disputed
by the inhabitants of Chêne la Populeux, or as it is vulgarly
called, “Chêne la Pouilleux.” They founded their claim upon a
privilege granted to their ancestors. It appeared that in the olden
time, the English had taken Rheims, plundered the city, and rifled
the tomb of St. Remy, from which they carried off the Sainte
Ampoule. The inhabitants of Chêne, however, had fallen upon
the invaders and recovered the inestimable treasure. From that
time, and in memory and acknowledgment of the deed, they had
enjoyed, as they said, the right to walk in the procession with the
knights of the Sainte Ampoule, and had been permitted to claim
the horse ridden by the Grand Prior. The Prior and his people
called these claimants scurvy knaves, and would by no means
attach any credit to the story. At the coronation of Louis XIII.
they did not scruple to support their claim by violence. They
pulled the Prior from his horse, terribly thrashed the monks who
came to his assistance, tore the canopy to pieces, thwacked the
knights right lustily, and carried off the steed in triumph. The
respective parties immediately went to law, and spent the value of
a dozen steeds, in disputes about the possession of a single horse.
The contest was decided in favor of the religious community; and
the turbulent people of Chêne were compelled to lead the quadruped
back to the abbey stables. They renewed their old claim
subsequently, and again threatened violence, much to the delight
of the attorneys, who thought to make money by the dissension.
At the coronations of Louis XV. and Louis XVI. these sovereigns
issued special decrees, whereby the people of Chêne were
prohibited from pretending to any property in the horse, and from
supporting any such pretensions by acts of violence.</p>

<p>The history of foreign orders would require a volume as large
as Anstis’s; but though I can not include such a history among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
my gossiping details, I may mention a few curious incidents connected
with</p>


<p class="c" id="c14">THE ORDER OF THE HOLY GHOST.</p>

<p>There is a singular circumstance connected with this order. It
was founded by the last of the Valois, and went out with the last
of the Bourbons. Louis Philippe had a particular aversion for
the orders which were most cherished by the dynasty he so cleverly
supplanted. The Citizen King may be said to have put down
both “St. Louis” and the “Holy Ghost” cavaliers. He did not
abolish the orders by decree; but it was clearly understood that no
one wearing the insignia would be welcome at the Tuileries.</p>

<p>The Order of the Holy Ghost was instituted by Henri, out of
gratitude for two events, for which no other individual had cause
to be grateful. He was (when Duke of Anjou) elected King of
Poland, on the day of Pentecost, 1573, and on the same day in
the following year he succeeded to the crown of France. Hence
the Order with its hundred members, and the king as grand
master.</p>

<p>St. Foix, in his voluminous history of the order, furnishes the
villanous royal founder with a tolerably good character. This is
more than any other historian has done; and it is not very satisfactorily
executed by this historian himself. He rests upon the
principle that the character of a king, or his disposition rather,
may be judged by his favorites. He then points to La Marck,
Mangiron, Joyeuse, D’Epernon, and others. Their reputations are
not of the best, rather of the very worst; but then St. Foix says
that they were all admirable swordsmen, and carried scars about
them, in front, in proof of their valor: he evidently thinks that the
<i>bellica virtus</i> is the same thing as the other virtues.</p>

<p>On the original roll of knights there are names now more worthy
of being remembered. Louis de Gonzague, Duke de Nevers, was
one of these. On one occasion, he unhorsed the Huguenot Captain
de Beaumont, who, as he lay on the ground, fired a pistol and
broke the ducal kneepan. The Duke’s squire bent forward with
his knife to despatch the Captain; the Duke, however, told the
latter to rise. “I wish,” said he, “that you may have a tale to
tell that is worth narrating. When you recount, at your fireside,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
how you wounded the Duke de Nevers, be kind enough to add that
he gave you your life.” The Duke was a noble fellow. Would
that his generosity could have restored his kneepan! but he limped
to the end of his days.</p>

<p>But there was a nobler than he, in the person of the Baron
d’Assier, subsequently Count de Crussol and Duke d’Uzes. He
was a Huguenot, and I confess that I can not account for the fact
of his being, at any time of his life, a Knight of the Order of the
Holy Ghost. Henri III. was not likely to have conferred the insignia
even on a pervert. His name, however, is on the roll. He
was brave, merciful, pious, and scrupulously honest. When he
captured Bergerai, he spared all who had no arms in their hands,
and finding the women locked up in the churches, he induced them
to return home, on promise of being protected from all molestation.
These poor creatures must have been marvellously fair; and the
baron’s eulogy on them reminds me of the expression of the soldiers
when they led Judith through the camp of Holofernes: “Who
could despise this people that have among them such women.”</p>

<p>The baron was not a little proud of his feat, and he thought that
if all the world talked of the continence of Scipio, he had a right
to claim some praise as the protector of female virtue. Accordingly,
in forwarding an account of the whole affair to the Duc de
Montpensier, he forwarded also a few samples of the ladies. “I
have <i>only</i> chosen twenty of the handsomest of them,” he writes,
“whom I have sent you that you may judge if they were not very
likely to tempt us to reprisals; they will inform you that they have
suffered not the least dishonor.” By sending them to Montpensier’s
quarters the ladies were in great danger of incurring
that from which the Baron had saved them. But he winds up
with a small lecture. He writes to the Duke: “You are a
devotee [!]; you have a ghostly father; your table is always
filled with monks; your hear two or three masses every day;
and you go frequently to confession. <i>I</i> confess myself only to
God. I hear no masses. I have none but soldiers at my table.
Honor is the sole director of my conscience. It will never advise
me to order violence against woman, to put to death a defenceless
enemy, or to break a promise once given.” In this lecture, there
was, in fact, a double-handed blow. Two birds were killed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
one stone. The Baron censured, by implication, both the Duke
and his religion. I was reminded of him by reading a review in
the “Guardian,” where the same skilful method is applied to criticism.
The reviewer’s subject was Canon Wordsworth’s volume
on Chevalier Bunsen’s “Hippolytus.” “The canon’s book,” said
the reviewer (I am quoting from memory), “reminds us—and it
must be a humiliation and degradation to an intelligent, educated,
and thoughtful man—of one of Dr. Cumming’s Exeter Hall lectures.”
Here the ultra high church critic stunned, with one blow,
the merely high-church priest and the no-church presbyterian.</p>

<p>There was generosity, at least, in another knight of this order,
Francis Goaffier, Lord of Crèvecœur. Catherine of Medicis announced
to him the appointment of his son to the command of a
regiment of foot. “Madame,” said the Knight of the Holy Ghost,
“my son was beset, a night or two ago, by five assassins; a Captain
La Vergne drew in his defence, and slew two of the assailants.
The rest fled, disabled. If your majesty will confer the regiment
on one who deserves it, you will give it to La Vergne.”—“Be it
so,” said Catherine, “and your son shall not be the less well provided
for.”</p>

<p>One, at least, of the original knights of this order was famous
for his misfortunes; this was Charles de Hallewin, Lord of Piennes.
He had been in six-and-twenty sieges and battles, and never came
out of one unscathed. His domestic wounds were greater still.
He had five sons, and one daughter who was married. The whole
of them, with his son-in-law, were assassinated, or died accidentally,
by violent deaths. The old chevalier went down to his tomb
heart-broken and heirless.</p>

<p>Le Roi, Lord of Chavigny, and who must not be mistaken for
an ancestor of that Le Roi who died at the Alma under the title
of Marshal St. Arnaud, is a good illustration of the blunt, honest
knight. Charles IX. once remarked to him that his mother, Catherine
de Medicis, boasted that there was not a man in France,
with ten thousand livres a year, at whose hearth she had not a spy
in her pay. “I do not know,” said Le Roi, “whether tyrants
make spies, or spies tyrants. For my own part, I see no use in
them, except in war.”</p>

<p>For honesty of a still higher sort, commend me to Scipio de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
Fierques, Lord of Lavagne. Catherine de Medicis offered to make
this, her distant relative, a marshal of France. “Good Heavens,
Madame!” he exclaimed, “the world would laugh at both of us.
I am simply a brave gentleman, and deserve <i>that</i> reputation; but
I should perhaps lose it, were you to make a marshal of me.” The
dignity is taken with less reluctance in our days. It was this honest
knight who was asked to procure the appointment of queen’s
chaplain for a person who, by way of bribe, presented the gallant
Scipio with two documents which would enable him to win a lawsuit
he was then carrying on against an obstinate adversary.
Scipio perused the documents, saw that they proved his antagonist
to be in the right, and immediately withdrew his opposition. He
left the candidate for the queen’s chaplaincy to accomplish the object
he had in view, in the best way he might.</p>

<p>There was wit, too, as might be expected, among these knights.
John Blosset, Baron de Torci, affords us an illustration. He had
been accused of holding correspondence with the enemy in Spain,
and report said that he was unworthy of the Order of the Holy
Ghost. He proved his innocence before a chapter of the order.
At the end of the investigation, he wittily applied two passages
from the prayer-book of the knights, by turning to the king, and
saying, “Domine ne projicias me a facie tuâ, et <i>spiritum sanctum
tuum</i> ne auferas a me.” “Lord, cast me out from thy presence,
and take not thy ‘Holy Spirit’ from me.” And the king bade
him keep it, while he laughed at the rather profane wit of John
Blosset.</p>

<p>There was wit, too, of a more practical nature, among these
knights of the Holy Spirit. The royal founder used occasionally
to retire with the knights to Vincennes. There they shut themselves
up, as they said, to fast and repent; but, as the world said,
to indulge in pleasures of a very monster-like quality. The royal
dukes of a later period in France used to atone for inordinate vice
by making their mistresses fast; the royal duchesses settled their
little balance with Heaven, by making their servants fast. It appears
that there was nothing of this vicarious penance in the case
of Henri III. and his knights. Not that all the knights willingly
submitted to penance which mortified their appetites. Charles de
la Marck, Count of Braine. was one of those impatient penitents.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
On a day on which rigid abstinence had been enjoined, the king
was passing by the count’s apartment, when he was struck by a
savory smell. King as he was, he immediately applied his eye to
the keyhole of the count’s door, and beheld the knight blowing
lustily at a little fire under a chafing-dish, in which there were two
superb soles frying in savory sauce. “Brother knight, brother
knight,” exclaimed Henri, “I see all and smell much. Art thou
not ashamed thus to transgress the holy rule?”—“I should be
much more so,” said the count, opening the door, “if I made an
enemy of my stomach. I can bear this sort of abstinence no longer.
Here am I, knight and gentleman, doubly famished in that
double character, and I have been, in my own proper person, to
buy these soles, and purchase what was necessary for the most delicious
of sauces: I am cooking them myself, and they are now
done to a turn. Cooked <i>aux gratins</i>, your majesty yourself can
not surely resist tasting. Allow me”—and he pushed forward a
chair, in which Henri seated himself, and to the “soles <i>aux
gratins</i>,” such as Vefour and Very never dished up, the monarch
sat down, and with the hungry count, discussed the merits of fasting,
while they enjoyed the fish. It was but meagre fare after all;
and probably the repast did not conclude there.</p>

<p>Charity is illustrated in the valiant William Pot (a very ancient
name of a very ancient family, of which the late archdeacon of
Middlesex and vicar of Kensington was probably a descendant).
He applied a legacy of sixty thousand livres to the support of
wounded soldiers. Henri III., who was always intending to accomplish
some good deed, resolved to erect an asylum for infirm
military men; but, of course, he forgot it. Henri IV., who has
received a great deal more praise than he deserves, also expressed
his intention to do something for his old soldiers; but he was too
much taken up with the fair Gabrielle, and she was not like Nell
Gwynne, who turned her intimacy with a king to the profit of the
men who poured out their blood for him. The old soldiers were
again neglected; and it was not till the reign of Louis XIV. that
Pot’s example was again recalled to mind, and profitable action
adopted in consequence. When I think of the gallant Pot’s legacy,
what he did therewith, and how French soldiers benefited
thereby, I am inclined to believe that the German troops, less well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
cared for, may thence have derived their once favorite oath, and
that <i>Potz tausend!</i> may have some reference to the sixty thousand
livres which the compassionate knight of Rhodes and the Holy
Ghost devoted to the comfort and solace of the brave men who
had been illustriously maimed in war.</p>

<p>The kings of France were accustomed to create a batch of
knights of the Holy Ghost, on the day following that of the coronation,
when the monarchs became sovereign heads of the order.
The entire body subsequently repaired from the Cathedral to the
Church of St. Remi, in grand equestrian procession, known as the
“cavalcade.” Nothing could well exceed the splendor of this procession,
when kings were despotic in France, and funds easily
provided. Cavalry and infantry in state uniforms, saucy pages in
a flutter of feathers and ribands, and groups of gorgeous officials
preceded the marshals of France, who were followed by the knights
of the Holy Ghost, after whom rode their royal Grand Master,
glittering like an Eastern king, and nodding, as he rode, like a
Mandarin.</p>

<p>The king and the knights performed their devotions before the
shrine of Saint Marcoul, which was brought expressly from the
church of Corbeni, six leagues distance from Rheims. This particular
ceremony was in honor of the celebrated old abbot of Nantua,
who, in his lifetime, had been eminently famous for his success
in curing the scrofulous disorder called “the king’s evil.” After
this devotional service, the sovereign master of the order of the
Holy Ghost was deemed qualified to cure the evil himself. Accordingly,
decked with the mantle and collar of the order, and
half encircled by the knights, he repaired to the Abbey Park to
touch and cure those who were afflicted with the disease in question.
It was no little labor. When Louis XVI. performed the
ceremony, he touched two thousand four hundred persons. The
form of proceeding was singular enough. The king’s first physician
placed his hand on the head of the patient; upon which a
captain of the guard immediately seized and held the patient’s
hands closely joined together. The king then advanced, head uncovered,
with his knights, and touched the sufferers. He passed
his right hand from the forehead to the chin, and from one cheek
to the other; thus making the sign of the cross, and at the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
time pronouncing the words, “May God cure thee; the king
touches thee!”</p>

<p>In connection with this subject, I may add here that Evelyn, in
his diary, records that Charles II. “began first to touch for the
evil, according to custom,” on the 6th of July, 1660, and after this
fashion. “His Majesty sitting under his state in the Banqueting
House, the chirurgeons caused the sick to be brought, and led up
to the throne, where they kneeling, the king strokes their faces or
cheeks with both his hands at once, at which instant a chaplain, in
his formalities, says, ‘He put his hands upon them, and He healed
them.’ This is said to every one in particular. When they have
been all touched, they come up again in the same order, and
the other chaplain kneeling, and having angel-gold strung on white
riband on his arm, delivers them one by one to his Majesty, who
puts them about the necks of the touched as they pass, while the
first chaplain repeats, ‘That is the true light who came into the
world.’” The French ceremonial seems to me to have been the
less pretentious; for the words uttered by the royal head of the
order of the Holy Ghost, simply formed a prayer, and an assertion
of a fact: “May God heal thee; the king touches thee!” And
yet who can doubt the efficacy of the royal hand of Charles II.,
seeing that, at a single touch, he not only cured a scrofulous Quaker,
but converted him into a good churchman?</p>

<p>The history of the last individual knight given in these imperfect
pages (Guy of Warwick), showed how history and romance
wove themselves together in biography. Coming down to a later
period, we may find another individual history, that may serve to
illustrate the object I have in view. The Chevalier de Bayard
stands prominently forward. But there was before <i>his</i> time, a
knight who was saluted by nearly the same distinctive titles which
were awarded to Bayard. I allude to Jacques de Lelaing, known
as “the knight without fear and without doubt.” His history is
less familiar to us, and will, therefore, the better bear telling. Besides,
Bayard was but a butcher. If he is not to be so accounted,
then tell us, gentle shade of Don Alonzo di Sotomayor, why thy
painful spirit perambulates the groves of Elysium, with a scented
handkerchief alternately applied to the hole in thy throat and the
gash in thy face? Is it not that, with cruel subtlety of fence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
Bayard run his rapier into thy neck “four good finger-breadths,”
and when thou wast past resistance, did he not thrust his dagger
into thy nostrils, crying the while, “Yield thee, Signor Alonzo, or
thou diest!” The shade of the slashed Spaniard bows its head in
mournful acquiescence, and a faint sound seems to float to us upon
the air, out of which we distinguish an echo of “<i>The field of
Monervyne</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">Between</span> the city of Namur and the quaint old town of Dinant
there is as much matter of interest for the historian as of beauty
for the traveller and artist. War has been the most terrible
scourge of the two localities on the Meuse which I have just
named. Namur has a present reputation for cutlery, and an old
one for “slashing blades” of another description. Don John, the
great victor at Lepanto, lies entombed in the city, victim of the
poison and the jealousy of his brother Philip. There the great
Louis proved himself a better soldier than Boileau did a poet,
when he attempted to put the royal soldier’s deeds into rhyme.
Who, too, can stand at St. Nicholas’s gate, without thinking of
“my uncle Toby,” and the Frenchmen, for whose dying he cared
so little, on the glacis of Namur? At present the place, it is true,
has but a dull and dreamy aspect. Indeed, it may be said of the
inhabitants, as of Molly Carew’s lovers, that “It’s dhrames and
not sleep that comes into their heads.” Such, at least, would seem
to be the case, if I may draw a conclusion from what I saw during
the last summer, at the bookseller’s stall at the Namur station,
where I found more copies of a work professing to interpret
dreams than of any other production, whether grave or <i>gaillard</i>.</p>

<p>Dinant, a curious old town, the high limestone-rocks behind
which seems to be pushing it from off its narrow standing-ground
into the Meuse, has even bloodier reminiscences than Namur; but
of these I will not now speak. Between the two cities, at the
most picturesque part of the stream, and on the loftiest cliff which
rises above the stream, is the vast ruin of the old <i>titanic</i> castle of
Poilvache, the once rather noisy home of the turbulent household<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
of those terrible brothers, known in chivalrous history as the
“Four Sons of Aymon.” During one of the few fine evenings
of the last summer, I was looking up at this height, from the opposite
bank, while around me stood in groups a number of those
brilliant-eyed, soft-voiced, ready-witted Walloons, who are said to
be the descendants of a Roman legion, whose members colonized
the country and married the ladies in it! A Walloon priest, or
one at least who spoke the dialect perfectly, but who had a strong
Flemish accent when addressing to me an observation in French,
remained during the period of my observation close at my side.
“Are these people,” said I to him, “a contented people?” He
beckoned to a cheerful-looking old man, and assuming that he was
contented with the dispensation that had appointed him to be a
laborer, inquired of him which part of his labor he loved best?
After pausing for a minute, the old peasant replied in very fair
French, “I think the sweetest task I have is when I mow that
meadow up at Bloquemont yonder, for the wild thyme in it embalms
the very air.” “But your winter-time,” said I, “must be
a dark and dreary time.” “Neither dark nor dreary,” was the
remark of a tidy woman, his wife, who was, at the moment, on her
knees, sewing up the ragged rents in the gaberdine of a Walloon
beggar—“Neither dark nor dreary. In winter-time, at home,
we don’t want light to get the children about us to teach them
their catechism.” The priest smiled. “And as for spring-time,”
said her husband, “you should be here to enjoy it; for the fields
are then all flower, and the sky is one song.” “There is poetry
in their expressions,” said I to the priest. “There is better than
that,” said he, “there is love in their hearts;” and, turning to
the woman who was mending the raiment of the passive mendicant,
he asked her if she were not afraid of infection. “Why
should I fear?” was her remark. “I am doing but little; Christ
did more; He washed the feet of beggars; and we must risk
something, if we would gain Paradise.” The particular beggar
to whom she was thus extending most practical charity was by no
means a picturesque bedesman; but, not to be behind-hand in
Χάρις toward him, I expressed compassion for his lot. “My lot
is not so deplorable,” said he, uncovering his head; “I have God
for my hope, and the charity of humane people for my succor.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
As he said this, my eye turned from him to a shepherd who had
just joined our group, and who was waiting to be ferried over to
the little village of Houx. I knew him by name, and knew
something of the solitariness of his life, and I observed to him,
“Jacques, you, at least, have a dull life of it; and you even now
look weary with the long hours you have been spending alone.”
“Alone!” he exclaimed, in a joyful tone, “I am never alone, and
never weary. How should I be either, when my days are passed
in the company of innocent animals, and time is given me to
think of God!” The priest smiled even more approvingly than
before; and I remarked to him, “We are here in Arcadia.”
“But not without human sin,” said he, and pointing to a woman at
a distance, who was in the employ of the farmer’s wife, he asked
the latter how she could still have anything to do with a well-known
thief. “Eh, father,” was the comment of a woman whom
John Howard would have kissed, “starving her in idleness would
not cure her of pilfering; and between working and being well-watched,
she will soon leave her evil habits.” “You are a good
Christian,” I said to her, “be you of what community you may.”
“She is a good Catholic,” added the priest. “I am what the good
God has made me,” was the simple reply of the Walloon wife;
“and my religion is this to go on my knees when all the house is
asleep, and then pray for the whole world.” “Ay, ay,” was the
chorus of those around her, “that is true religion.” “It is a part
of true religion,” interposed the priest; but I could not help thinking
that he would have done as well had he left Marie Justine’s
text without his comment. We walked together down to the bank
of the river opposite the Chateau of the young Count de Levignon
the proprietor and burgomaster of Houx. I looked up from
the modern chateau to the ruins of the vast castle where the sons
of Aymon once held barbaric state, maintained continual war, and
affected a reverence for the mother of Him who was the Prince
of Peace. The good priest seemed to guess my thoughts, for he
remarked, “We live now in better times; the church is less splendid,
and chivalry less ‘glorious,’ if not extinct; but there is a
closer brotherhood of all men—at least,” he added hesitatingly—“at
least I hope so.” “I can not remember,” said I, “a single
virtue possessed by either Aymon or his sons, except brute courage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
and a rude sort of generosity, not based on principle, but born of
impulse. It is a pity that Belgium can not boast of more perfect
chevaliers than the old proprietors of Poilvache, and that you
have not a hero to match with Bayard.” “Belgium,” was his
answer, “can make such boast, and had a hero who had finished
his heroic career long before Bayard was born. Have you never
heard of ‘the Good Knight without fear and without doubt’?”
“I have heard of one without fear and without reproach.” “That
title,” he remarked, “was but a plagiarism from that conferred on
Jacques de Lelaing, by his contemporaries.” And then he sketched
the outline of the good knight’s career, and directed me to sources
where I might gather more detailed intelligence. I was interested
in what I learned, and it is because I hope also to interest readers
at home, that I venture to place before them, however imperfectly
rendered, a sketch of the career of a brave man before the time
of Bayard; one who illustrates the old saying that—</p>

<p>Jacques de Lelaing, the good knight, without fear and without
doubt, was born in the château of Lelaing, in the first quarter of
the fifteenth century. The precise year is not known, but it was
full half a century before the birth of Bayard. He came of a
noble race; that is, of a race, the male portion of which saw more
honor in slaughter than in science. His mother was celebrated
for her beauty as well as nobility. She was wise, courteous, and
<i>débonnaire</i>; well-mannered, and full of all good virtues. So, at
least, in nearly similar terms, wrote George Chastellan of her, just
two centuries ago.</p>

<p>Jacques de Lelaing was as precocious a boy as the Duke of
Wharton in his youth. At the age of seven, a priestly tutor had
perfected him in French and Latin, and the good man had so imbued
him with literary tastes that, in after life, the good knight
found time to cultivate the acquaintance of Captain Pen, as well
as of Captain Sword; and specimens of his handiwork are yet
said to exist in the libraries of Flanders and Brabant.</p>

<p>Jacques, however, was never a mere student, “sicklied o’er with
the pale cast of thought.” He loved manly sports; and he was
yet but a blooming youth when the “demoiseau of Clèves,” nephew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
of that great Duke whom men, for no earthly reason, called Philip
<i>the Good</i>, carried off his young friend from the castle of Lelaing,
and made of him a squire, not of dames, but of knights, in the
turbulent court of the ducal Philip, with the benevolent qualification
to his name.</p>

<p>The youth entered upon his career with a paternal provision
which bespoke at once the liberality and the wisdom of his father,
stout William de Lelaing. The sire bestowed upon his son four
splendid horses, a well-skilled groom, and a “<i>gentleman of service</i>”
which, in common phrase, means a valet, or “gentleman’s
gentleman.” But the young soldier had more than this in his
brain; namely, a well-lettered cleric, commissioned to be for ever
expounding and instructing, with a special object, to boot, that
Jacques should not forget his Latin! Excellent sire thus to care
for his son! If modern fathers only might send into barracks with
their sons, when the latter first join their regiments, reverend
clerks, whose office it should be to keep their pupils well up in
their catechism, the Eton grammar, and English orthography,
what a blessing it would be to the young gentlemen and to all
acquainted with them! As it is, we have officers worse instructed
and less intelligent than the sons of the artists who make their
uniforms.</p>

<p>When Jacques went forth into the world, his sire gave him as
good advice as Polonius threw away on his son Laertes. The sum
of it was according to the old French maxim, “Noblesse oblige”—“Inasmuch,”
said the old man, “as you are more noble than others
by birth, so,” said he, “should you be more noble than they by
virtues.” The hearty old father added an assurance, that “few
great men gained renown for prowess and virtue who did not
entertain love for some dame or damoiselle.” This last, however,
was but an equivocal assurance, for by counselling Jacques to fall
in love with “some dame or damoiselle,” he simply advised him
to do so with any man’s wife or daughter. But it was advice commonly
given to young gentlemen in arms, and is, to this day, commonly
followed by them. Jacques bettered the paternal instruction,
by falling in love with two ladies at the same time. As ambitious
youths are wont to do, he passed by the white and pink young
ladies whom he met, and paid his addresses, with remarkable success,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
to two married duchesses. Neither of these suspected that
the smooth-chinned young “squire” was swearing eternal fidelity
to the other, or that this light-mailed Macheath wooed his madiæval
Polly with his pockets full of “favors,” just bestowed on him
by an unsuspecting Lucy. Thus has love ever been made by officers
and highwaymen.</p>

<p>But if Jacques loved two, there was not a lady at the Court of
Burgundy who did not love <i>him</i>. The most virtuous of them
sighingly expressed a wish that their husbands, <i>or their lovers</i>,
were only like him. The men hated him, while they affected to
admire his grace, his bearing, and his irresistible bravery. Jacques
very complacently accepted the love of the women and the envy
of the men; and feeling that he had something to be thankful for,
he repaired to the shrine of the Virgin at Hal, and thanked “Our
Lady,” accordingly.</p>

<p>Now Philip the Good was good only just as Nicholas the Czar
was “good.” He had a fair face and a black heart. Philip, like
Nicholas, joined an outward display of conjugal decency with some
private but very crapulous indecency; and the Duke, like the
Czar, was <i>the</i> appalling liar of his day. Philip had increased the
ducal territory of Burgundy by such means as secured Finland to
Muscovy, by treachery of the most fiendish quality; and in 1442,
affecting to think that Luxembourg was in the sick condition
which Nicholas described as the condition of Turkey—when the
imperial felon thought he was making a confederate of Sir Hamilton
Seymour, the Duke resolved to seize on the territory in question,
and young Jacques de Lelaing was in an ecstacy of delight at
being permitted to join in this most rascally of expeditions.</p>

<p>Within a year, desolation was spread throughout a wide district.
Fire and sword did their devastating work, and the earth was
swept of the crops, dwellings, and human beings, which lay between
the invaders and Luxembourg. The city was ultimately
taken by surprise, and the good Philip delivered it up to pillage;
then ensued a scene which hell itself could not equal; and the
Duke and his followers having enacted horrors from which devils
would have recoiled, they returned to Brussels, where they were
received with ten times more delight than if they had come back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
from an expedition which had been undertaken for the benefit of
humanity.</p>

<p>What was called <i>peace</i> now followed, and Jacques de Lelaing,
having fleshed his maiden sword, and gained the praise of brave
men, and the love of fair women, resolved to commence a series
of provincial excursions for his own especial benefit. As, in modern
times, professors without scholars, and actors without engagements,
wander from town to town, and give lectures at “the King’s
Arms,” so Jacques de Lelaing went forth upon his way, offering
to fight all comers, in presence of kings themselves.</p>

<p>His first appearance on this provincial tour was at Nancy, in
1445, where a brilliant French Court was holding joyous festival
while awaiting the coming of Suffolk, who was commissioned to
escort to England a royal bride, in the person of Margaret of
Anjou. The French knights made light of the soldier of Burgundy;
but Jacques, when announcing that he was the holder of the
tournament, added that no French knight should unhorse him, unless
God and his good lady decreed otherwise.</p>

<p>The latter was not likely, and he felt himself secure, doubly so,
for he rode into the lists decorated with favors, gold embroidery,
and rich jewels, the gifts of the Duchesses of Orleans and Calabria,
each of whom fondly believed that she was the sole fair one by
whose bright eyes Jacques de Lelaing swore his prettiest oath.
Accordingly, there was not a cavalier who rode against him in that
passage of arms, who left the field otherwise than with broken or
bruised bones. “What manner of man will this be?” cried they,
“if, even as a lad, he lays on so lustily?”</p>

<p>The lad, at the subsequent banquet, to which he was borne in
triumph, again proved that he had the capacity of a man. He
was fresh as a rose just blown; gay as a lark in early spring.
The queens of France and Sicily conversed with him by the half
hour, while ladies of lower degree gazed at him till they sighed;
and sighed, knowing full well <i>why</i>, and caring very much, wherefore.
Charles VII. too, treated him with especial distinction, and
conferred on him the rich prizes he had won as victor in the rough
tourney of the day. But there were other guerdons awarded him
that night, which he more highly prized. Jacques visited the
Duchess of Orleans in her bower, and carried away with him, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
leaving, the richest diamond she had to bestow. He then passed
to the pavilion of the Duchess of Calabria, a lady who, among
other gifts willingly made by her, placed upon his finger a brilliant
ruby set in a gorgeous gold ring. He went to his own bed that
night as impudently happy as a modern Lifeguardsman who is
successfully fooling two ladies’ maids. His <i>cleric</i> had left him,
and Jacques had ceased to care for the keeping-up of his Latin,
except, perhaps, the conjugation of the imperative mood of <i>amo</i>.
“Amemus,” <i>let us love</i>, was the favorite part of the mood, and the
most frequently repeated by him and his brace of duchesses.</p>

<p>Sometime after this very successful first appearance, and toward
the end of 1445, our doughty squire was traversing the cathedral
of Notre Dame of Antwerp, and was on the point of cursing the
singers for their bad voices, just as one might be almost justified
in doing now, so execrable are they; he was there and thus engaged,
when a Sicilian knight, named Bonifazio, came jingling his
spurs along the transept, and looking jauntingly and impertinently
as he passed by. Jacques looked boldly at this “pretty fellow” of
the time, and remarked that he wore a golden fetter ring on his
left leg, held up by a chain of the same metal fastened to a circlet
above his knee. His shield bore the device, “Who has fair lady,
let him look to her well!” “It’s an impertinent device,” said
Jacques, touching the shield, by way of token that he would fight
the bearer for carrying it. “Thou art but a poor squire, albeit a
bold man,” said the Sicilian, with the air of one who was half inclined
to chastise the Hainaulter for his insolence. Toison d’Or,
the herald, whispered in the ear of the Hainaulter; thereupon,
Jacques exclaimed, “If my master, Duke Philip, will give me
permission to fight, thou darest not deny me, on his Grace’s territory.”
Bonifazio bowed by way of assent. The permission was
gained, and the encounter came off at Ghent. The first day’s
combat was a species of preliminary struggle on horseback, in
which Jacques showed himself so worthy of the spurs he did not
yet wear, that Philip fastened them to his heels the next day, and
dubbed him Knight in solemn form. As the combatants strode
into the lists, on the second day, the Duke of Orleans remarked to
his Duchess, that Jacques was not so “gent as the Sicilian.” The
Duchess smiled, as Guinever smiled when she looked on Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
Launcelot, while her husband, King Arthur, commented upon him;
and she said, in phrase known to all who read Spenser, “he loves
a lady gent;” and she added, with more of the smile and less of
the blush, “he is a better man than the Sicilian, and, to my thinking,
he will this day prove it.”</p>

<p>“We shall see,” remarked the Duke carelessly.</p>

<p>“We shall see,” re-echoed the Duchess, with the sunniest of
smiles.</p>

<p>Jacques, like the chivalric “gent” that he was, did honor to the
testimony of the Duchess. The combatants went at it, like stout
men. Jacques belabored his antagonist with a staff, the Sicilian
answered by thrusting a javelin at his adversary’s uncovered face.
They then flung away their arms and their shields, and hewed at
each other with their battle-axes. Having spoiled the edges of
these, and loosened them from their handles, by battering at each
other’s skulls, they finally drew their lusty and well-tempered
swords, and fought so fiercely that the gleaming of their swiftly
manœuvred blades made them seem as if they were smiting each
other with lightning. Jacques had well-nigh dealt a mortal thrust
at the Sicilian, when, at the intervention of the Duke of Orleans,
Philip the Good flung his truncheon into the lists, and so saved
the foreign knight, by ending the fray. The Duchess reproved
her consort for being over-intrusive, but she smiled more gleesomely
than before. “Whither away, Sir Jacques?” asked she, as the
latter modestly bowed on passing her—the multitude the while
rending the welkin with their approving shout. “To the chapel
in the wood,” replied Jacques, “to render thanks for the aid vouchsafed
to me by our Lady.” “Marry,” murmured the Duchess,
“we will be there too.” She thought it not less edifying to see
knight at his devotions than at beholding him in the duello. “I
am grateful to the Lady of Good Succor,” said Jacques. “And
thou doest right loyally,” was the comment of the Duchess.</p>

<p>The victory of the Belgian cavalier over the Sicilian gained for
him the distinctive name which he never lost, that of “the Good
Knight.” To maintain it, he proceeded to travel from court to court,
as pugilists itinerate it from fair to fair, to exhibit prowess and to
gather praise. The minor pugilist looks to pence as well as praise,
and the ancient knight had an eye to profit also—he invariably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
carried off the horse, armor, and jewels of the vanquished. As
Sir Jacques deemed himself invincible, he looked to the realization
of a lucrative tour. “Go on thy way, with God’s blessing,” exclaimed
his sire. “Go on thy way, Jacques,” murmured his
mother through her tears; “thou wilt find ointment in thy valise,
to cure all bruises. Heaven send thee a surgeon, and thou break
thy bones.”</p>

<p>Across the French frontier merrily rode Sir Jacques, followed
by his squire, and attended by his page. From his left arm hung
a splendidly-wrought helmet, by a chain of gold—the prize offered
by him to any one who could overcome him in single combat.
Jacques announced that, in addition, he would give a diamond to
any lady or demoiselle indicated to him by his conqueror. He
stipulated that whichever combatant first dropped his axe, he should
bestow a bracelet upon his adversary; and Jacques would only
fight upon the condition that neither knight should be fastened in
his saddle—a regulation which I should never think of seeing insisted
upon anywhere, except by equestrian aldermen when they
amble on Mr. Batty’s horses, to meet the Sovereign at Temple
Bar. For the rest Jacques put his trust in God, and relied upon
the strength given him in the love of “the fair lady who had more
power over him than aught besides throughout the entire world.”
A hundred ladies fair, matrons and maids, who heard of this well-advertised
confidence, did not hesitate to exclaim, “Delicious fellow!
He means <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>It was the proud boast of Jacques, that he traversed the capital,
and the provincial cities of France, without meeting with a knight
who would accept his defiance. It would be more correct to say—a
knight who <i>could</i> take up his challenge. Charles VII. forbade
his chivalry from encountering the fierce Hainaulter anywhere
but at the festive board. In the South of France, then held
by the English, he met with the same civility; and he rode fairly
into Spain, his lance in rest, before his onward career was checked
by the presence of an adversary. That adversary was Don Diego
de Guzman, Grand-master of Calatrava, and, although he knew it
not, ancestor to a future Empress of the French. The Don met
the Belgian on the borders of Castile, and accepted his published
challenge out of mere love, as the one silly fellow said of the other,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
out of mere love for his “<i>très aimée dame</i>.” The “<i>dames</i>” of those
days enjoyed nothing so much as seeing the gentlemen thwack
each other; and considering what a worthless set these latter, for
the most part, were, the ladies had logically comic reasons to support
their argument.</p>

<p>It was necessary, however, for Don Diego to obtain the consent
of his sovereign to encounter in mortal combat a knight of the
household of Burgundy, then in alliance with Spain. The Sovereign
was absent from the country, and while an answer was being
expected from him to the application duly made, Jacques, at the
head of a most splendid retinue, trotted leisurely into Portugal, to
tempt the Lusitanian knights to set their lances against him. He
rode forward to the capital, and was greeted by the way, as if he
had been as illustrious a monarch as his ducal master. It was one
ovation, from the frontier to Lisbon, where he was welcomed by
the most crowded of royal balls, at which the King (Alphonso
XV.) invited him to foot it with the Queen. The King, however,
was but an indifferent master of the ceremonies. The late Mr.
Simpson of Vauxhall, or the illustrious Baron Nathan of Rosherville,
would never have dreamed of taking the lady to introduce
her to the gentleman. This uncourteous process was, however,
the one followed by Alphonso, who taking his consort by the hand,
led her to Sire Jacques, and bad him tread a measure with her.
Messire Jacques consented, and there was more than enough of
dancing, and feasting, and pleasure-seeking, but no fighting. Lisbon
was as dull to the Belgian as Donnybrook Fair without a
skrimmage used to be to all its lively <i>habitués</i>. “I have had a
turn with the Queen,” said Jacques, “let me now have a tourney
with your captains.” “Burgundy is my good friend,” answered
the King—and he was right in a double sense, for Burgundy was
as dear to him as Champagne is to the Czar’s valet, Frederick
William, who resides at Berlin. “Burgundy is our good friend,”
answered Alphonso, “and Heaven forbid that a knight from such
a court should be roughly treated by any knights at mine.” “By
St. George! I defy them!” exclaimed Jacques. “And even so
let it rest,” said the monarch; “ride back to Castile, and do thy
worst upon the hard ribs of the Guzman.” Jacques adopted the
suggestion; and on the 3d of February, 1447, there was not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
bed in Valladolid to be had “for love or money;” so crowded was
that strong-smelling city with stronger-smelling Spaniards, whose
curiosity was even stronger than the odors they distilled, to witness
the “set-to” between the Belgian Chicken and the Castile
Shaver!</p>

<p>I will not detail the preliminary ceremonies, the processions to
the field, the entry of the sovereigns, the fluttering of the ladies,
the excitement of the knights, and the eagerness of the countless
multitude. Jacques was on the ground by ten o’clock, where
Guzman kept him waiting till three; and then the latter came
with an axe so much longer than that wielded by the Belgian, that
even the Spanish umpires forbade its being employed. Don
Diego’s own “godfather” for the occasion was almost minded to
thump him with the handle; and there was all the trouble in the
world to induce him to select another. This being effected, each
knight was conducted to his tent, with the understanding that he
was not to issue therefrom until the clarions had thrice sounded by
way of signal. At the very first blast, however, out rushed the
Guzman, looking as ferocious as a stage Richard who has killed
five false Richmonds, and is anxiously inquiring for the real one
wherewith to finish the half-dozen. The too volatile Don was
beckoned back by the chief herald as haughtily as when the sempiternal
Widdicombe points out with his whip some obvious duty
to be performed by Mr. Merryman. Diego retired muttering, but
he again appeared in front of his tent at the second note of summons
from the trumpet, and only withdrew after the king had
assailed him “with an ugly word.” At the third “flourish,” the
two champions flew at each other, battle-axe in hand. With this
weapon they hammered at each other’s head, until there was little
sense left in either of them. At length, Diego was disarmed;
then ensued a contest made up partly of wrestling and partly of
boxing; finally, they had recourse to their swords, when the king,
perceiving that murder was likely to ensue, to one or both, threw
his bâton into the lists, put an end to the combat, and refused permission
to the adversaries to continue the struggle on horseback.
The antagonists shook hands, and the people shouted. The Spanish
knight is deemed, by Belgian chroniclers, as having come off
“second best” in the struggle; but it is also clear that Diego de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
Guzman was by far the “toughest customer” that ever confronted
Jacques de Lelaing. There was some jealousy on the part of the
Iberian, but his behavior was, altogether, marked by generosity.
He praised the prowess of Jacques, and presented him with an Andalusian
horse covered with the richest trappings; and de Lelaing,
as unwilling to be outdone in liberality as in fight, sent to Guzman,
by a herald, a magnificent charger, with coverings of blue velvet
embroidered in gold, and a saddle of violet velvet, to be seated in
which, was of itself a luxury. Much dancing at court followed;
and finally, the “good knight” left Valladolid loaded with gifts from
the king, praises from men, and love from the ladies, who made
surrender of more hearts than he had time to accept.</p>

<p>In Navarre and in Aragon he challenged all comers, but in
vain. Swords slept in scabbards, and battle-axes hung quietly
from saddle-bows, and there was more feasting than fighting. At
length Jacques, after passing through Perpignan and Narbonne,
arrived at Montpelier, where he became the guest of the famous
Jacques Cœur, the silversmith and banker of Charles VII. Old
Cœur was a hearty old host, for he offered the knight any amount
of money he would honor him by accepting; and he intimated
that if De Lelaing, in the course of his travels had found it necessary
to pawn any of his plate or jewelry, <i>he</i> (Jacques Cœur)
would redeem it free of expense. “My good master, the Duke
of Burgundy,” replied the errant chevalier, “provides all that is
necessary for me, and allows me to want for nothing;” and thereupon
he went on his way to the court of Burgundy, where he was
received with more honor than if he had been executing a mission
for the especial benefit of humanity.</p>

<p>But these honors were little, compared with the rejoicings which
took place when the “good knight” revisited his native château,
and the parents who therein resided. His sire hugged him till his
armor was warm again; and his lady mother walked about the
halls in a state of ecstacy and thanksgiving. Finally, the rafters
shook at the efforts of the joyous dancers, and many a judicious
matron instructed her daughter how Jacques, who subdued the
stoutest knights, might be himself subdued by the very gentlest
of ladies. The instruction was given in vain. The good chevalier
made love alike to young widows, wives, and daughters, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
having broken more hearts than he ever broke lances, he suddenly
left home in search of new adventures.</p>

<p>Great was the astonishment, and <i>that</i> altogether of a pleasurable
sort, when the herald Charolais appeared at the Scottish court in
July, 1449, and delivered a challenge from Jacques to the whole
of the Douglases. It was accepted in their name by James
Douglas, the brother of the lieutenant-general of the kingdom; and
in December of the year last named, Jacques, with a retinue of
fighting uncles, cousins, and friends, embarked at Ecluse and set
sail for Caledonia. The party were more battered about by the
sea than ever they had been by enemy on land; and when they
arrived at Leith, they looked so “shaky,” were so pale and haggard,
and had so little of a “slashing” look, wrapped up as they
were in surcoats and comforters, that the Scottish cavaliers, observing
the draggled condition of the strangers and of the plumes
which seemed to be moulting from their helmets, fairly asked them
what motive induced them to come so far in so sorry a plight, for
the mere sake of getting bruised by knights ashore after having
been tossed about, sick and sorry, during whole nights at sea.
When the northern cavaliers heard that honor and not profit had
moved the Belgian company, they marvelled much thereat, but
prepared themselves, nevertheless, to meet the new-comers in
dread encounter at Stirling.</p>

<p>James II. presided at the bloody fray, in which three fought
against three. What the Scottish chroniclers say of the struggle,
I can not learn, but the Belgian historians describe their champions
as having been eminently victorious with every arm; and,
according to them, the Douglases were not only soundly drubbed,
but took their beating with considerable sulkiness. But there is
much poetry in Belgian history, and probably the doughty Douglas
party may not have been so thoroughly worsted as the pleasant
chroniclers in question describe them to have been. No doubt
the conquerors behaved well, as we know “les braves Belges”
have never failed to do, if history may be credited. However
this may be, Jacques and his friends hurried from Scotland, appeared
at London before the meek Lancastrian king, Henry VI.;
and as the latter would not license his knights to meet the Burgundians
in the lists, the foreign fighting gentlemen had their passports<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
<i>visé</i>, and taking passage in the fast sailer “Flower of
Hainault,” duly arrived at home, where they were hailed with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Jacques had short space wherein to breathe. An English
knight, named Thomas Karr, speedily appeared at the court of
Philip the Duke, and challenged De Lelaing, for the honor of old
England. This affair caused a great sensation, and the lists were
dressed in a field near Bruges. The English knight was the
heavier man in flesh and armor, but Jacques, of course, was the
favorite. Dire was the conflict. The adversaries strove to fell
each other with their axes, as butchers do oxen. Karr paralyzed,
if he did not break, the arm of Jacques; but the Belgian, dropping
his axe, closed with his foe, and after a struggle, fell with and
upon him. Karr was required, as a defeated man, to carry the
gauntlet of the victor to the lady pointed out by him. But obstinate
Tom Karr protested against this, as he had only fallen on
his elbow. The umpires declared that he had had a full fall,
“head, belly, arms, and legs;” Jacques, however, was generous
and would not insist. On the contrary, adverting to the fact that
he had himself been the first to drop his own axe, he presented
Karr with a rich diamond, as the forfeit due by him who first lost
a weapon in the combat.</p>

<p>Karr had terribly wounded Jacques, and the wound of the latter
took long to cure. The Duke Philip hastened his convalescence
by naming him counsellor and chamberlain; and as soon as
the man so honored by his master, had recovered from his wounds,
he repaired to Chalons on Saone, where he opened a “tourney,”
which was talked of in the country for many a long year afterward.
Jacques had vowed that he would appear in the closed
lists thirty times before he had attained his thirtieth year; and
this tourney at Chalons was held by him against all comers, in
order the better to enable him to fulfil his vow. The detail would
be tedious; suffice it to say that the affair was of barbarian magnificence,
and that knights smashed one another’s limbs, for personal
honor, ladies’ love, and the glory of Our Lady in Tears! Rich
prizes were awarded to the victors, as rich forfeits were exacted
from the vanquished, and there was not only a sea of good blood
spilt in this splendidly atrocious fray, but as much bad blood made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
as there was good blood shed. But then there was empty honor
acquired, a frail sort of affection gained, and an impalpable glory
added to the non-existent crown of an imaginary Venus Victrix,
decorated with the name of Our Lady of Tears! What more
could true knights desire? Chivalry was satisfied; and commonplace
men, with only common sense to direct them, had to look on
in admiring silence, at risk of being cudgelled if they dared to
speak out.</p>

<p>Jacques was now at the height of his renown. He was “the
good knight without fear and without doubt;” and Duke Philip
placed the last rose in his chaplet of honor, by creating him a
knight of the illustrious order of the Golden Fleece. Thus distinguished,
he rode about Europe, inviting adversaries to measure
swords with him, and meeting with none willing to accept the invitation.
In 1451 he was the embassador of Burgundy at Rome,
charged to negotiate a project of crusade against the Turks. M.
Alexander Henne, the author of the best compendium, gathered
from the chronicles, of the deeds of Jacques de Lelaing—says
that after the knight’s mission to Rome, he appeared at a passage
of arms held in the park at Brussels, in honor of the Duke of
Burgundy’s son, the Count of Charolais, then eighteen years of
age, and about to mate his first appearance in the lists. The
Duchess, tender of her son as the Dowager Czarina who kept her
boys at home, and had not a tear for other mothers, whose children
have been bloodily sacrificed to the savage ambition of
Nicholas—the Duchess careful of the young Count, was desirous
that he should make essay before he appeared in the lists.
Jacques de Lelaing was accordingly selected to run a lance with
him. “Three days before the fete, the Duke, the Duchess, and
the Court repaired to the park of Brussels, where the trial was to
be made. In the first onset, the Count de Charolais shattered his
lance against the shield of Jacques, who raised his own weapon,
and passed without touching his adversary. The Duke perceived
that the good knight had spared his young adversary; he was displeased
thereat, and sent Jacques word that if he intended to continue
the same course, he would do well to meddle no further in
the matter. Other lances were then brought, and Jacques, running
straight against the Count, both lances flew into splinters.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
At this incident, the Duchess, in her turn, gave expression to her
discontent; but the Duke only laughed; and thus mother and
father were of different opinions; the one desiring a fair trial, the
other security for her son.” On the day of the great tourney,
there were assembled, with the multitude, on the great square at
Brussels, not less than two hundred and twenty-five princes, barons,
knights, and squires. Some of the noblest of these broke a lance
with, and perhaps the limbs of, their adversaries. The Count de
Charolais broke eighteen lances on that day, and he carried off the
the prize, which was conferred upon him by the ladies.</p>

<p>This was the last of the show-fights in which Jacques de
Lelaing exhibited himself. The bloodier conflicts in which he
was subsequently engaged, were far less to his credit. They
formed a part of the savage war which the despotic Duke and the
nobles carried on against the free and opulent cities, whose spirit
of liberty was an object of hatred, and whose wealth was an object
of covetous desire, to the Duke and his body of gentleman-like
assassins. Many a fair town was devastated by the Duke
and his followers, who affected to be inspired by religious feelings,
a desire for peace, and a disinclination to make conquests.
Whereby it may be seen that the late Czar was only a Burgundian
duke enlarged, impelled by much the same principle, and
addicted to a similar sort of veracity. It was a time of unmitigated
horrors, when crimes enough were committed by the nobles to render
the name of aristocracy for ever execrable throughout Belgium;
and atrocities were practised by the enraged commons, sufficient
to insure, for the plebeians, the undying hatred of their patrician
oppressors. There was no respect on either side for age, sex, or
condition. The people, of every degree, were transformed into
the worst of fiends—slaying, burning, violating, and plundering;
and turning from their accursed work to kneel at the shrine of
that Mary whose blessed Son was the Prince of Peace. Each
side slaughtered, hung, or drowned its prisoners; but the nobles
gave the provocation by first setting the example, and the commons
were not cruel till the nobility showed itself alike destitute of
honor and of mercy. The arms of the popular party were nerved
by the infamy of their adversaries, but many an innocent man on
either side was condemned to suffer, undeservedly, for the sins of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
others. The greatest efforts were made against the people of the
district and city of Ghent, but all Flanders sympathized with them
in a war which was considered national. In the struggle, the
Duke won no victory over the people for which the latter did not
compel him to pay a frightful price; he was heartily sick of the
war before it was half concluded—even when his banner was being
most successfully upheld by the strong arm and slender scruples
of Jacques de Lelaing.</p>

<p>The good knight was however, it must be confessed, among the
few—if he were not the only one—of the betterminded nobles.
He had been commissioned by the Duke to set fire to the Abbey
of Eenaeme, and he obeyed without hesitation, and yet with
reluctance. He destroyed the religious edifice with all which it
contained, and which could be made to burn; but having thus
performed his duty as a soldier, he forthwith accomplished his
equally bounden duty, as a Christian—and, after paying for three
masses, at which he devoutly assisted, he confessed himself to a
predicant friar, “making a case of conscience,” says one of his
biographers, “of having, out of respect for discipline, committed
an act which the uprightness of his heart compelled him to condemn
as criminal.” Never was there a better illustration of that
so-called diverse condition of things which is said to represent a
distinction without a difference.</p>

<p>The repentance of Jacques de Lelaing came, it is hoped, in time.
He did well, at all events, not to defer it any longer, for he was
soon on the threshold of that world where faith ceases and belief
begins. He was engaged, although badly wounded, in inspecting
the siege-works in the front of the Chateau de Pouckes, that
Flemish cradle of the Pooks settled in England. It was on a
June afternoon of the year 1453, that Jacques, with a crowd of
nobles half-encircling him, rode out, in spite of the protest of his
doctors (because, as he said, if he were to remain doing nothing he
should certainly die), in order that he might have <i>something</i> to do.
There was a famous piece of artillery on the Burgundian side,
which was sorely troublesome to the stout little band that was defending
Pouckes. It was called the “Shepherdess,” but never did
shepherdess speak with so thundering-unlovely a voice, or fling
her favors about her with such dire destruction to those upon whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
they were showered. Jacques drew up behind the <i>manteau</i> of
this cannon, to watch (like our gallant seamen at Sebastopol) the
effects of the shot discharged from it. At the same moment a
stone projectile, discharged from a culverin by the hand of a young
artilleryman of Ghent, who was known as the son of Henry the
Blindman, struck Jacques on the forehead, carrying away the upper
part of his head, and stretched him dead upon the field. A Carmelite
brother rushed up to him to offer the succor and consolation
of religion, but it was too late. Jacques had sighed out his last
breath, and the friar decently folded the dead warrior’s arms over
his breast. A mournful troop carried the body back to the camp.</p>

<p>The hero of his day died in harness. He had virtues that fitted
him for a more refined, a more honest, in short, a more Christian,
period. These he exercised whenever he could find opportunity, but
such opportunity was rare. He lived at a period when, as M. de Sismondi
has remarked, “Knights thought of nothing but equalling the
Rolands and Olivers of the days of Charlemagne, by the destruction
of the vile canaille”—a sort of pastime which has been recently
recommended in our senate, although the days of chivalry be gone.
The noble comrades of Jacques, as M. Henne observes, acknowledged
but one species of supreme pleasure and glory, which consisted
in making flow abundantly the blood of villains—or, as they
are now called, the lower orders. But in truth the modern “villain”
or the low-class man is not exclusively to be found in the ranks
which have had such names applied to them. As Bosquier-Gavaudan
used so joyously to sing, some thirty years ago, in the
<i>Ermite de St. Avelle</i>:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent0">Sont souvent des gens de rien;</div>
    <div class="verse indent13">Et les gens de rien</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sont souvent des gens de bien!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>For a knight, Jacques was really a respectable man, and so disgusted
with his butcher-like occupation, that, just before his death,
he had resolved to surrender his estate to a younger brother, and,
since fate had made of him a licensed murderer, to henceforth
murder none but eastern infidels—to slay whom was held to be
more of a virtue than a sin. Let us add of him, that he was too
honest to earn a reputation by being compassionate to half-a-dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
helpless foes, after directing his men to slaughter a score of the
mutilated and defenceless enemy. Jacques de Lelaing would
sooner have sent his dagger up to the hilt in his own heart, than
have violated the safeguard of a flag of truce. <i>Such</i> days and
such doings of chivalry are not those most agreeable to Russian
chivalry. Witness Odessa, where the pious governor directed the
fire on a flag of truce which he swore he could not see; and witness
the massacre of Hango, the assassins concerned in which exploit
were defended by their worthy superior De Berg.</p>

<p>Jacques de Lelaing, however, it must not be forgotten, fell in a
most unworthy cause—that of a despot armed against free people.
His excellent master swore to avenge him; and he kept his word.
When the Château de Pouckes was compelled to surrender, Philip
the Good ordered every one found alive in it to be hung from the
walls. He made exception only of a priest or two, one soldier
afflicted with what was called <i>leprosy</i>, but which has now another
name in the catalogue of avenging maladies, and a couple of boys.
It was precisely one of these lads who had, by his well-laid shot,
slain “the good knight without fear and without doubt;” but Philip
was not aware of this till the lad was far beyond his reach, and in
safety at Ghent.</p>

<p>Those who may be curious to know the course taken by the
war until it was terminated by the treaty of Lille, are recommended
to study the Chronicles of De Lettenhooe, of Olivier de la
Marche, of Chastellain, and Du Clery. I had no intention, at setting
out, to paint a battle-piece, but simply to sketch a single figure.
My task is done, however imperfectly, and, as old chroniclers were
wont to say, May Heaven bless the gentle reader, and send pistoles
and abounding grace to the unworthy author.</p>

<p>Such is the history of an individual; let us now trace the fortunes
of a knightly house. The story of the Guises belongs entirely
to chivalry and statesmanship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">In</span> the pleasant spring-time of the year 1506, a little boy, mounted
on a mule, and accompanied by a serving man on foot, crossed
over the frontier from Lorraine into France. The boy was a
pretty child, some ten years old. He was soberly clad, but a
merry heart beat under his gray jerkin; and his spirits were as
light as the feather in his bonnet. The servant who walked at
his side was a simple yet faithful follower of his house; but there
was no more speculation in his face than there was in that of the
mule. Nothing could have looked more harmless and innocent
than the trio in question; and yet the whole—joyous child, plodding
servitor, and the mule whose bells rang music as he trod—formed
one of the most remarkable invasions of which the kingdom
of France has ever been the victim.</p>

<p>The boy was the fifth child of René and Philippa de Gueldres,
the ducal sovereigns of Lorraine. This duchy, a portion of the
old kingdom of Lotharingia—in disputes for the possession of
which the children of Charlemagne had shed rivers of blood—had
maintained its independence, despite the repeated attempts of Germany
and France to reduce it to subjection. At the opening of
the sixteenth century, it had seen a legal succession of sovereign
and independent masters during seven centuries. The reigning
duke was René, the second of that name. He had acquired estates
in France, and he had inherited the hatred of Lorraine to
the Capetian race which had dethroned the heirs of Charlemagne.
It was for this double reason that he unostentatiously sent into the
kingdom of France one of his sons, a boy of fair promise. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
mission of the yet unconscious child was to increase the territorial
possessions of his family within the French dominions, and ultimately
to rule both Church and State—if not from the throne,
why then from behind it.</p>

<p>The merry boy proved himself in course of time to be no unfitting
instrument for this especial purpose. He was brought up
at the French court, studied chivalry, and practised passages of
arms with French knights; was the first up at <i>réveillée</i>, the last
at a feast, the most devout at mass, and the most winning in ladies’
bower. The princes of the blood loved him, and so did the princesses.
The army hailed him with delight; and the church beheld
in him and his brother, Cardinal John, two of those champions
whom it records with gladness, and canonizes with alacrity.</p>

<p>Such was Claude of Lorraine, who won the heart and lands of
Antoinette de Bourbon, and who received from Francis I. not
only letters of naturalization, but the title of Duke of Guise. The
locality so named is in Picardy. It had fallen to the house of
Lorraine by marriage, and the dignity of Count which accompanied
it was now changed for that of Duke. It was not long before
Claude made the title famous. The sword of Guise was never
from his grasp, and its point was unceasingly directed against the
enemies of his new country. He shed his own blood, and spilled
that of others, with a ferocious joy. Francis saw in him the
warmest of his friends and the bravest of his soldiers. His
bravery helped to the glory that was reaped at Marignan, at Fontarabia,
and in Picardy. Against internal revolt or foreign invasion
he was equally irresistible. <i>His</i> sword drove back the Imperialists
of Germany within their own frontier; and when on the
night of Pavia the warriors of France sat weeping like girls amid
the wide ruin around them, <i>his</i> heart alone throbbed with hopeful
impulses, and <i>his</i> mind only was filled with bright visions of victories
to come.</p>

<p>These came indeed, but they were sometimes triumphs that
earned for him an immortality of infamy. The crest of his house
was a double cross, and this device, though it was no emblem of
the intensity of religion felt by these who bore it, <i>was</i> significant
of the double sanguinary zeal of the family—a zeal employed
solely for selfish ends. The apostolic reformers of France were,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
at this period, in a position of some power. Their preachers were
in the pulpit, and their people in the field. They heard the gospel
leaning on their swords; and, the discourse done, they rushed
bravely into battle to defend what they had heard.</p>

<p>Against these pious but strong-limbed confederates the wrath
of Guise was something terrible. It did not, like that of Francis
I.—who banqueted one day the unorthodox friends whom he
burned the next—alternate with fits of mercy. It raged without
intermission, and before it the Reformers of Alsatia were swept
as before a blast in whose hot breath was death. He spared neither
sex nor age; and he justified his bloody deeds by blasphemously
asserting that he was guided to them by the light of a cross
which blazed before him in the heavens. The church honored
him with the name of “good and faithful servant;” but there are
Christian hearths in Alsatia where he is still whisperingly spoken
of as “the accursed butcher.”</p>

<p>When his own fingers began to hold less firmly the handle of
his sword, he also began to look among his children for those who
were most likely to carry out the mission of his house. His eye
marked, approvingly, the bearing of his eldest son Francis, Count
D’Aumale; and had no less satisfaction in the brothers of Francis,
who, whether as soldiers or priests, were equally ready to further
the interests of Lorraine, and call them those of Heaven. His
daughter Mary he gave to James V. of Scotland; and the bride
brought destruction for her dowry. Upon himself and his children,
Francis I., and subsequently Henry II., looked at last with
mingled admiration and dread. Honors and wealth were lavished
upon them with a prodigal and even treasonable liberality. The
generous king gave to the insatiate Guise the property of the
people; and when these complained somewhat menacingly, Guise
achieved some new exploit, the public roar of applause for which
sanctioned a quiet enjoyment of his ill-gotten treasures.</p>

<p>For the purpose of such enjoyment he retired to his castle at
Joinville. The residence was less a palace than a monastery. It
was inhabited by sunless gloom and a deserted wife. The neglected
garden was trimmed at the coming of the duke, but not for
his sake nor for that of the faithful Antoinette. Before the eyes
of that faithful wife he built a bower for a mistress who daily degraded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
with blows the hero of a hundred stricken fields. He
deprecated the rough usage of the courtesan with tears and gold;
and yet he had no better homage for the virtuous mother of his
children, than a cold civility. His almost sudden death in 1550
was accounted for as being the effect of poison, administered at
the suggestion of those to whom his growing greatness was offensive.
The accusation was boldly graven on his monument; and
it is probably true. No one however, profited by the crime.</p>

<p>The throne found in his children more dangerous supporters
than he had ever been himself; and the people paid for their
popular admiration with loss of life and liberty. The church,
however, exulted; for Claude of Lorraine, first Duke of Guise,
gave to it the legitimate son, Cardinal Charles, who devised the
massacre of the day of St. Bartholomew; and the illegitimate
son, the Abbé de Cluny, who, on that terrible day, made his dagger
drink the blood of the Huguenots, till the wielder of it became
as drunk with frenzy as he was wont to be with the fiery wine
which was his peculiar and intense delight.</p>

<p>The first Duke of Guise only laid a foundation, upon which he
left his heirs and successors to build at their discretion. He had,
nevertheless, effected much. He had gained for his family considerable
wealth; and if he had not also obtained a crown, he had
acquired possession of rich crown-lands. The bestowing upon him
of these earned popular execration for the king; the people, at
the same time, confessed that the services of Guise were worthy
of no meaner reward. When King Francis saw that he was
blamed for bestowing what the recipient was deemed worthy of
having granted to him, we can hardly wonder that Francis, while
acknowledging the merits of the aspiring family, bade the members
of his own to be on their guard against the designs of every child
of the house of Lorraine.</p>

<p>But <i>he</i> was no child who now succeeded to the honors of his
father, the first duke. Francis of Guise, at his elevation to the
ducal title, saw before him two obstacles to further greatness.
One was a weak king, Henry II.; and the other, a powerful
favorite, the Constable de Montmorency, from whose family, it
was popularly said, had sprung the first Christian within the realm
of France. Francis speedily disposed of the favorite, and almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
as speedily raised himself to the vacant office, which he exercised
so as to further his remote purposes. In the meantime the king
was taught to believe that his crown and happiness were dependent
on his Lorraine cousins, who, on their side, were not only
aiming at the throne of France for one member of the house, but
were aspiring to the tiara for a second; the crown of Naples for
a third—to influence in Flanders and in Spain, and even to the
diadem of Elizabeth of England, succession to which was recognised
as existing in them, by Mary Stuart, in case of her own
decease without direct heirs. It is said that the British Romanists
looked forward with unctuous complacency to the period when
the sceptre of this island should fall into the blood-stained grasp
of a “Catholic Guise.”</p>

<p>It was not only the fortune of Francis to repair the ill luck encountered
in the field by Montmorency, but to gain advantages in
fight, such as France had not yet seen. The Emperor Charles V.
had well-nigh got possession of beleaguered Metz, when Guise
threw himself into the place, rescued it from the Emperor, and
swept the Imperialists out of France. His fiery wrath cooled
only in presence of the wounded, to whom he behaved with gentle
and helping courtesy. His gigantic labors here brought on an
attack of fever; and when he was compelled to seek rest in his
house at Marchez, a host of priests and cardinals of his family
gathered round his court, and excited him to laughter by rough
games that suited but sorrily with their calling.</p>

<p>The second duke inherited his father’s hatred for “heretics.”
The great Colligny had been his bosom friend; but when that
renowned Reformer gave evidence of his new opinions upon religious
subjects, then ensued, first a coldness, then fits of angry
quarrelling, and at last a duel, in which, though neither combatant
was even scratched, friendship was slain for ever. Duke Francis
was prodigal like his father, but then his brother, Cardinal Charles,
was minister of the finances: and the king and his mistress, Diana
de Poictiers, cared not how the revenue was managed, so that
money was forthcoming when necessity pressed. The consequence
was, that the king’s exchequer was robbed to supply the extravagances
of Guise. But then men began to associate with the name
the idea of deliverance from oppression; and they did not count<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
the cost. And yet victory did not invariably select for her throne
the glittering helm of the aspiring duke. The pope had selected
him as commander of the papal army acting against Naples, but
intrigue paralyzed the arm which had never before been conquered,
and the pontiff showered epigrams upon him instead of laurels.</p>

<p>In this momentary eclipse of the sun of his glory, the duke
placed his own neck under the papal heel. He served in the
pope’s chapel as an Acolyte, meekly bore the mantle of obese and
sneering cardinals, and exhibited a humility which was not without
success. When at a banquet given by a cardinal, Guise humbly
sat down at the lower end of the table, he asked a French officer
who was endeavoring to thrust in below him, “Why comest thou
here, friend?” “That it might not be said,” answered the soldier,
“that the representative of the King of France took the very
lowest place at a priest’s table!”</p>

<p>From such reproaches Guise gladly fled, to buckle on his armor
and drive back an invasion of France by the Hispano-Flemings
on the north. The services he now rendered his country made
the people almost forget the infamy of their king, who was wasting
life in his capital, and the oppressive imposts of the financial cardinal,
whom the sufferers punningly designated as Cardinal <i>La
Ruine</i>. The ruin he achieved was forgiven in consideration of
the glory accomplished by his brother, who had defeated and destroyed
the armies which threatened the capital from the north;
and who had effected much greater glory by suddenly falling on
Calais with a force of ten to one, and tearing from the English
the last of the conquests till then held by them in France. Old
Lord Wentworth, the governor, plied his artillery with a roar that
was heard on the English coast: but the roar was all in vain.
There was a proverb among our neighbors, and applied by them
to every individual of mediocre qualifications, that “he was not
the sort of man to drive the English out of France.” That man
was found in Guise; and the capital began naturally to contrast
him with the heartless king, who sat at the feet of a concubine,
and recked little of the national honor or disgrace. And yet, the
medals struck to commemorate the recovery of Calais bear the
names only of Henri and Diana. They omit all mention of the
great liberator, Guise!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>The faults of Henri, however, are not to be entirely attributed
to himself. He had some feelings of compassion for the wretched
but stout-hearted Huguenots, with whom, in the absence of Guise,
he entered into treaties, which, Guise present, he was constrained
to violate! In pursuit of the visions of dominion in France, and
of the tiara at Rome, the ambitious house sought only to gain the
suffrages of the church and the faithful. To win smiles from
them, the public scaffolds were deluged with the blood of heretics;
and all were deemed so who refused to doff their caps to the
images of the virgin, raised in the highways at the suggestion of
the duke and the cardinal. This terrific persecution begat remonstrance;
but when remonstrance was treated as if it were rebellion,
rebellion followed thereupon; as, perhaps, was hoped for;
and the swords of the Guisards went flashing over every district
in France, dealing death wherever dwelt the alleged enemies of
God, who dared to commune with Him according to conscience,
rather than according to Rome. Congregations, as at Vassi, were
set upon and slaughtered in cold blood, without resistance. In the
Huguenot “temple” of this last place was found a Bible. It was
brought to the duke. This noble gentleman could spell no better
than the great Duke of Marlborough; and Guise was, moreover,
worse instructed in the faith which he professed. He looked into
the Book of Life, unconscious of what he held, and with a wondering
exclamation as to what it might be all about, he flung it
aside, and turned to the further slaughter of those who believed
therein.</p>

<p>In such action he saw his peculiar mission for the moment, but
he was not allowed to pursue it unopposed. His intrigues and his
cruelties made rebels even of the princes of the blood; and Condé
took the field to revenge their wrongs, as well as those of the
Reformers. The issue was tried on the bloody day at Dreux,
when the setting sun went down on a Protestant army routed, and
on Condé a captive; but sharing the bed, as was the custom of
the time, of his proved victor Guise. Never did two more deadly
enemies lie on the same couch, sleepless, and full of mutual suspicion.
But the hatred of Condé was a loyal hatred; that of
Guise was marked by treacherous malignity. The Protestant
party, in presence of that hot fury, seemed to melt away like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
snow-wraith in the sun. He and his Guisards were the terror of
the so-called enemies of the Faith. Those whom he could not
reach by the sword, he struck down by wielding against them the
helpless hand of the king, who obeyed with the passiveness of a
<i>Marionette</i>, and raised stakes, and fired the pile, and gave the
victim thereto, simply because Guise would so have it.</p>

<p>The duke received one portion at least of his coveted reward.
At every massacre of inoffensive Protestants, the Catholic pulpits
resounded with biblical names, showered down upon him by the
exulting preachers. When his banner had swept triumphantly
over successive fields, whose after-crops were made rich by heretical
blood, then did the church pronounce him to be a soldier
divinely armed, who had at length “consecrated his hands, and
avenged the quarrel of the Lord.”</p>

<p>Guise lived, it is true, at a period when nothing was held so
cheap as life. Acts of cruelty were but too common in all factions.
If he delivered whole towns to pillage and its attendant
horrors, compared with which death were merciful, he would himself
exhibit compassion, based on impulse or caprice. He was
heroic, according to the thinking of his age, which considered
heroism as being constituted solely of unflinching courage. In
all other respects, the duke, great as he was, was as mean as the
veriest knave who trailed a pike in his own bands. Scarcely a
letter addressed to his officers reached them without having been
previously read to their right worshipful master. There was
scarcely a mansion in the kingdom, whose lord was a man of influence,
but that at that table and the hearth there sat a guest who
was the paid spy of Francis of Guise.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add that his morality generally was on
a par with the particular specimens we have given of it. Crowds
of courtesans accompanied him to the camp, while he deliberately
exposed his own wife, Anne of Este, the sister of Tasso’s Leonora,
to the insulting homage of a worthless king. Emphatically may
it be said that the truth was not in him. He gloried in mendacity.
No other personage that I can call to mind ever equalled him in
lying—except, perhaps, those very highly professing heroes who
swagger in Greek tragedy. He procured, by a lie, the capital
conviction of Condé. The latter escaped the penalty, and taxed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
the duke with his falsehood. Guise swore by his sword, his life,
his honor, his very soul, that he was innocent of the charge.
Condé looked on the ducal liar with a withering contempt, and
turned from him with a sarcasm that should have pierced him like
a sword. Pointed as it was, it could not find way through his
corslet to his heart. He met it with a jest, and deemed the sin
unregistered.</p>

<p>There was a watchful public, nevertheless, observing the progress
made toward greatness by the chivalric duke, and his brother
the cardinal. Henry II. had just received the mortal blow dealt
him at a tournament by the lance of Montgomery. Francis II.,
his brother, the husband of Mary Stuart, and therewith nephew
to Guise, succeeded to the uneasy throne and painful privileges
of Henri. On the night of this monarch’s decease, two courtiers
were traversing a gallery of the Louvre. “This night,” said one,
“is the eve of the Festival of the Three Kings.” “How mean
you by that?” asked the other with a smile. “I mean,” rejoined
the first, “that to-morrow we shall have three monarchs in Paris—one
of them, King of France; the others Kings <i>in</i> France—from
Lorraine.”</p>

<p>Under the latter two, Duke and Cardinal, was played out the
second act of the great political drama of Lorraine. It was altogether
a melo-drama, in which there was abundance of light and
shadow. At times, we find the hero exhibiting exemplary candor;
anon, he is the dark plotter, or the fierce and open slayer of his
kind. There are stirring scenes of fights, wherein his adversaries
draw their swords against him, at the instigation of a disgusted
King, who no sooner saw Guise triumphant, than he devoted to
death the survivors whom he had clandestinely urged into the fray.</p>

<p>The battles were fought, on one side, for liberty of conscience;
on the other, for the sake of universal despotism. The bad side
triumphed during a long season; and field after field saw waving
over it the green banner of Lorraine. Catherine de Medicis, and
her son Charles IX., accompanied the Duke in more than one
struggle, after the short-lived reign of Francis II. had come to an
end. They passed, side by side, through the breach at Rouen;
but accident divided them at Orleans, where had assembled the
gallant few who refused to despair for the Protestant cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>Guise beleaguered the city, and was menacingly furious at its
obstinacy in holding out. One evening he had ridden with his
staff to gaze more nearly at the walls, from behind which defiance
was flung at him. “You will never be able to get in,” remarked
roughly a too presuming official. “Mark me!” roared the chafed
Duke, “yon setting sun will know to-morrow how to get behind
that rampart; and by Heaven, so will I!” He turned his horse,
and galloped back alone to his quarters. He was encountered on
his way by a Huguenot officer, Poltrot de la Mer, who brought
him down by a pistol-shot. The eyes of the dying Duke, as he
lay upon the ground, met for the last time the faint rays of that
departing sun, with which he had sworn to be up and doing on the
morrow. He died in his hut. His condition was one of extreme
“comfortableness.” He had robbed the King’s exchequer to gratify
his own passions;—and he thanked Heaven that he had been
a faithful subject to his sovereign! He had been notoriously unfaithful
to a noble and virtuous wife; and he impressed upon her
with his faltering lips, the assurance that “generally speaking” his
infidelity as a husband did not amount to much worth mentioning!
He confessed to, and was shriven by his two brothers, Cardinals
John and Charles. The former was a greater man than the Duke.
The latter was known in his own times and all succeeding, as “the
bottle cardinal,” a name of which he was only not ashamed, but
his title to which he was ever ostentatiously desirous to vindicate
and establish.</p>

<p>The first Duke had acquired possession of crown-lands; the
second had at his disposal the public treasure; and the third hoped
to add to the acquisitions of his family the much-coveted sceptre
of the Kings of France.</p>

<p>Henri, surnamed <i>Le Balafré</i>, or “the scarred,” succeeded his father
in the year 1560. During the greater portion of his subsequent
life, his two principal objects were the destruction of Protestantism,
and the possession of the King’s person. He therewith flattered
the national vanity by declaring that the natural limits of France,
on two sides, were the Rhine and the Danube—an extension of
frontier which was never effected, except temporarily, in the latter
days of Napoleon. But the declaration entailed a popularity on
the Duke which was only increased by his victory at Jarnac,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
when the French Protestants not only suffered defeat, but lost
their leader, the brave and unfortunate Condé. This gallant chief
had surrendered, but he was basely murdered by a pistol-shot, and
his dead body, flung across an ass, was paraded through the ranks
of the victors, as a trophy. How far the Duke was an accomplice
in the crime, is not determined. That such incidents were deemed
lightly of by him, is sufficiently clear by his own proclamation in
seven languages, wherein he accused Coligny as the instigator of
the murder of the late Duke of Guise, and set a price upon that
noble head, to be won by any assassin.</p>

<p>For that so-called murder, Guise had his revenge on the day
of St. Bartholomew, when he vainly hoped that the enemies of his
house had perished for ever. On the head of more than one
member of the house of Guise rests the responsibility of that terrible
day. During the slaughter, Guise gained his revenge, but lost
his love. The cries of the victims were the nuptial songs chanted
at the marriage-ceremony of Henri of Navarre and Margaret, the
King’s sister. The latter had looked, nothing loath, upon the suit
offered to her by Guise, who was an ardent wooer. But the
wooing had been roughly broken in upon by the lady’s brother,
the Duc d’Anjou, who declared aloud in the Louvre, that if Guise
dared look with lover’s eyes upon “Margot,” he would run his
knife into the lover’s throat! The threat had its influence, and
the unfaithful wooer, who had been all the while solemnly affianced
to a Princess Catherine of Cleves, married that remarkable brunette,
and showed his respect for her, by speaking and writing of
her as “that amiable lady, the negress.” It may be noticed in
passing, that the objection of D’Anjou to Guise as a brother-in-law,
was not personal; it had a political foundation. The two
dukes became, indeed, brothers-in-law; not by Guise marrying
the sister of D’Anjou, but by D’Anjou marrying the sister of
Guise, and by sharing with her the throne which he, subsequently,
occupied rather than enjoyed, as Henri III.</p>

<p>When summoned to the throne by the unedifying death of
Charles IX., Henry of Anjou was king of Poland. He escaped
from that country with difficulty, in order to wear a more brilliant
but a more fatal crown in France. He had no sooner assumed it,
when he beheld the Guises encircling him, and leaving him neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
liberty nor will. The Protestants were driven into rebellion.
They found a leader in Henry of Navarre, and Guise and his
friends made war against them, irrespective of the King’s consent,
and cut in pieces, with their swords, the treaties entered into between
the two Henrys, without the consent of the third Henri—of
Guise and Lorraine. The latter so completely enslaved the
weak and unhappy sovereign, as to wring from him, against his
remonstrance and conviction, the famous articles of Nemours,
wherein it was solemnly decreed in the name of the King, and
confirmed by the signature of Guise, that, thenceforward, it was
the will of God that there should be but one faith in France, and
that the opposers thereof would find that opposition incurred death.</p>

<p>There is a tradition that when Henri III. was told of this decree,
he was seated in deep meditation, his head resting upon his
hand; and that when he leaped to his feet with emotion, at the
impiety of the declaration, it was observed that the part of his
moustache which had been covered by his hand, had suddenly
turned gray.</p>

<p>The misery that followed on the publication of these infamous
articles was widely spread, and extended to other hearths besides
those of the Huguenots. Sword, pestilence, and famine, made a
desert of a smiling country; and the universal people, in their
common sorrow, cursed all parties alike—“King and Queen,
Pope and Calvin,” and only asked from Heaven release from all,
and peace for those who suffered by the national divisions. The
King, indeed, was neither ill-intentional nor intolerant; but Guise
so intrigued as to persuade the “Catholic” part of the nation that
Henri was incapable. Faction then began to look upon the powerful
subject as <i>the</i> man best qualified to meet the great emergency.
He fairly cajoled them into rebellion. They were, indeed, willing
to be so cajoled by a leader so liberal of promises, and yet he was
known to be as cruel as he engaged himself to be liberal. He
often kept his own soldiers at a point barely above starvation;
and the slightest insubordination in a regiment entailed the penalty
of death. To his foes he was more terrible still. As he stood in
the centre of a conquered town that had been held by the Huguenots,
it was sport to him to see the latter tossed into the flames.
On one occasion he ordered a Huguenot officer to be torn asunder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
by young horses for no greater crime than mutilating a wooden
idol in a church. The officer had placed the mutilated figure on
a bastion of the city, with a pike across its breast, as a satire on
the guardianship which such a protector was popularly believed
to afford.</p>

<p>He could, however, be humane when the humor and good reason
for it came together. Thus he parted with a pet lioness, which
he kept at his quarters, on the very sufficient ground that the
royal beast had, on a certain morning, slain and swallowed one of
his <i>favorite</i> footmen! A commonplace lacquey he might have
spared without complaining; but he could not, without some irritation,
hear of a <i>valet</i> being devoured who, though a valet, had a profound
belief that his master was a hero.</p>

<p>The “Bartholomew” had not destroyed all the foes of the name
of Guise. What was not accomplished on that day was sought
to be achieved by the “League.” The object of this society was
to raise the Duke to the throne of Henri, either before or after
the death of the latter. The King was childless, and the presumptive
heir to the throne, Henri of Navarre, was a Protestant.
The Lorrainers had double reason, then, for looking to themselves.
The reigning sovereign was the last of three brothers who had inherited
the crown, and there was then a superstitious idea that
when three brothers had reigned in France, a change of dynasty
was inevitable.</p>

<p>Guise fired his followers with the assurance that the invasion
of England, and the establishment of Popery there, should be an
enterprise which they should be called upon to accomplish. The
King was in great alarm at the “League,” but he wisely constituted
himself a member. The confederates kept him in the dark
as to the chief of their objects. The suspicious monarch, on the
other hand, encouraged his minions to annoy his good cousin of
Lorraine. One of these unworthy favorites, St. Megrim, did
more: he slandered the wife of Guise, who took, thereon, a
singular course of trial and revenge. He aroused his Duchess
from her solitary couch, in the middle of the night, hissed in her
alarmed ear the damning rumor that was abroad, and bade her
take at once from his hands the dagger or the poison-cup, which
he offered her:—adding that she had better die, having so greatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
sinned. The offended and innocent wife cared not for life, since
she was suspected, and drank off the contents of the cup, after
protestation of her innocence. The draught was of harmless preparation,
for the Duke was well assured of the spotless character
of a consort whom he himself daily dishonored by his infidelities.
He kissed her hand and took his leave; but he sent a score of his
trusty-men into the courtyard of the Louvre, who fell on St.
Megrim, and butchered him almost on the threshold of the King’s
apartments.</p>

<p>The monarch made no complaint at the outrage; but he raised
a tomb over the mangled remains of his favorite minion, above
which a triad of Cupids represented the royal grief, by holding
their stony knuckles to their tearless eyes, affecting the passion
which they could not feel.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while the people were being pushed to rebellion
at home, the ducal family were intriguing in nearly every
court in Europe. Between the intrigues of Guise and the recklessness
of the King, the public welfare suffered shipwreck. So
nearly complete was the ruin, that it was popularly said, “The
Minions crave all: the King gives all; the Queen-mother manages
all; Guise opposes all; the Red Ass (the Cardinal) embroils
all, and would that the Devil had all!”</p>

<p>But the opposition of Guise was made to some purpose. By
exercising it he exacted from the King a surrender of several
strong cities. They were immediately garrisoned by Guisards,
though held nominally by the sovereign. From the latter the
Duke wrung nearly all that it was in the power of the monarch
to yield; but when Guise, who had a design against the life of the
Protestant Henri of Navarre, asked for a royal decree prohibiting
the granting of “quarter” to a Huguenot in the field, the
King indignantly banished him from the capital. Guise feigned
to obey; but his celebrated sister, the Duchess of Montpensier,
refused to share in even a temporary exile. This bold woman
went about in public, with a pair of scissors at her girdle, which,
as she intimated, would serve for the <i>tonsure</i> of brother Henri of
Valois, when weariness should drive him from a palace into a
monastery.</p>

<p>The King, somewhat alarmed, called around him his old Swiss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
body guard, and as the majority of these men professed the reformed
faith, Guise made use of the circumstance to obtain greater
ends than any he had yet obtained. The people were persuaded
that their religion was in peril; and when the Duke, breaking his
ban, entered Paris and, gallantly attired, walked by the side of
the sedan of Catherine of Medicis, on their way to the Louvre,
to remonstrate with the unorthodox king, the church-bells gave
their joyous greeting, and the excited populace hung upon the
steps of the Duke, showering upon him blessings and blasphemous
appellations. “Hosanna to our new son of David!” shouted
those who affected to be the most pious; and aged women, kissing
his garment as he passed, rose from their knees, exclaiming, “Lord,
now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have
seen thy salvation!”</p>

<p>The less blasphemous or the more sincere sufficiently expressed
their satisfaction by hailing him, as he went on his way, smiling,
“King of Paris!”</p>

<p>The sound of this title reached the ears of Henri. Coupling
it with the unauthorized return of Guise to court, he passed into
alternate fits of ungovernable wrath and profound melancholy.
He was under the influence of the latter when there fell on his
ear, words which make him start from his seat—“<i>Percutiam pastorem,
et dispergentur oves</i>;” and when the Monarch looked round
for the speaker, he beheld the Abbé d’Elbene, who had thus calmly
quoted Scripture, in order to recommend murder. The King,
though startled, was not displeased. On the contrary, he smiled;
and the smile was yet around his lips, and in his eyes, when Guise
entered the presence, and mistook the expression of the royal face
for one of welcome. The Duke, emboldened by what he saw,
hurried through a long list of grievances, especially dwelling on
the lenity, not to say favor, with which Henri treated the heretics
generally. The sovereign made a few excuses, which Guise
heeded not; on the contrary, he hastened to denounce the body of
minions who polluted the palace. “Love me, love my dog,” said
Henri, in a hoarse voice. “Yes,” answered Guise, peering into
the royal and unnaturally sparkling eyes, “provided he doesn’t
bite!” The two men stood revealed before each other; and from
that hour the struggle was deadly. Henri would not give away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
with reference to his Swiss guard; and Guise, passing through
Paris, with his sword unsheathed, awoke the eager spirit of revolt,
and looked complacently on while the barricades were raised to
impede the march of the execrable Calvinistic Archers of the
Guard. The “King of Paris” earned a decisive victory; but before
it was achieved, the King of France hurried, in an agony of
cowardly affright, from his capital. He gazed for a moment on
the city, as he departed, venting curses on its ingratitude; for, said
the fugitive Monarch, “I loved you better than I did my own
wife;”—which was indisputably true.</p>

<p>Guise might now have ascended the throne, had he not been too
circumspect. He deemed the royal cause lost, but he was satisfied
for the moment with ruling in the capital, as generalissimo.
He stopped the King’s couriers, and opened his letters. He confiscated
the property of Huguenots, and sold the same for his own
benefit, while he professed to care only for that of the Commonwealth.
Finally, he declared that the disturbed condition of affairs
should be regulated by a States-General, which he commanded
rather than prayed Henri to summon to a meeting at Blois. The
King consented; and the 18th of October, 1588, was appointed
for the opening. Guise entered the old town with his family, and
a host of retainers, cased in armor, and bristling with steel.
Henri had his mother Catherine at his side; but there were also
a few faithful and unscrupulous followers with him in the palace
at Blois; and as he looked on any of those who might happen to
salute him in passing, the King smiled darkly, and <i>Percutiam
pastorem</i> fell in murmured satisfaction from his lips. The saturnine
monarch became, all at once, cheerful in his outward bearing,
even when Guise was so ruling the States as to make their proceedings
turn to the detriment of the monarchy. The Guise faction
became anxious for the safety of their leader, whose quarters
were in the palace; but when the King, in token of reconciliation
begged the Duke to participate with him in the celebration of the
Holy Sacrament, there was scarcely a man capable of interpreting
the manner of the times, who did not feel assured that under such
a solemn pledge of security, there lay concealed the very basest
treachery. Guise, over-confident, scorned alike open warning and
dark innuendoes. He was so strong, and his royal antagonist so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
weak, that he despised the idea of violence being used against him—especially
as the keys of the palatial castle were in his keeping,
as “Grand-Master” of the Court.</p>

<p>The 23d of December had arrived. The King intimated that
he should proceed early in the morning, soon after daybreak (but
subsequently to holding a council, to which he summoned the
Duke and Cardinal), to the shrine of Our Lady of Clery, some
two miles distant; and the keys of the gates were demanded, in
order to let Henri have issue at his pleasure, but in reality to keep
the Guises within, isolated from their friends without. Larchant,
one of the Archers of the Guard, also waited upon the Duke, to
pray him to intercede for himself and comrades with the King, in
order to obtain for them an increase of pay. “We will do ourselves
the honor,” said Larchant, “to prefer our petition to your
Highness, in the morning, in a body.” This was a contrivance to
prevent Guise from being surprised at seeing so many armed men
together in the King’s antechamber, before the council was sitting.
Henri passed a sleepless night. His namesake of Guise, who had
just sent his Duchess homeward, her approaching confinement being
expected, spent the whole of the same night in the apartments
of the Countess de Noirmoutier.</p>

<p>He was seen coming thence, before dawn, gayly dressed, and
proceeding to the Chapel of the Virgin, to perform his morning
devotions. Long before this, the King was a-foot, visiting the
select archers who had accepted the bloody mission of ridding the
perplexed monarch of his importunate adversary. He posted
them, altered the arrangements, reposted them, addressed them
again and again on the lawfulness of their office, and had some
trouble to suppress an enthusiasm which threatened to wake the
Queen-mother, who slept below, and to excite the suspicion of the
Guards in the vicinity. Staircase and hall, closet and arras, no
coign of vantage but had its assassin ready to act, should his fellows
have failed.</p>

<p>Precisely at seven o’clock, Guise, attired in a light suit of gray
satin, and followed by Pericart, his secretary, entered the council-chamber,
where he found several members assembled; among
others, his younger brother, the “Bottle-Cardinal” de Guise. An
hour passed without the appearance of any message from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
King, who was in an inner apartment, now half-frightened at the
pale faces of his own confidants, and anon endeavoring to excite
his own resolution, by attempts to encourage theirs. It was a long
and weary hour for all parties. As it slowly passed away, Guise,
he knew not wherefore, grew anxious. He complained of the
cold, and heaped billets of wood upon the fire. He spoke of feeling
sick, faint, and unnerved; and from his silver sweetmeat-case
he took a few bonbons, by way of breakfast. He subsequently
asked for some Damascus raisins, and conserve of roses; but
these, when supplied to him did not relieve him of an unaccountable
nervousness, which was suddenly increased, when the eye
next to the scar from which he derived his appellation of <i>Le Balafré</i>,
began to be suffused with tears. He indignantly wiped away
the unwelcome suffusion, and had quite recovered as Rivol, Secretary
of State, entered, and requested him to attend on the King,
who awaited him in his own chamber.</p>

<p>Guise gayly flung his <i>bonbonnière</i> across the council-table, and
laughingly bade the grave counsellors scramble for the scattered
sweets. He started up, overturned his chair in so doing, drew his
thin mantle around him, and with cap and gloves in hand, waved
a farewell to the statesmen present. He passed through two
rooms, and closely followed by various of the archers, reached the
tapestried entrance to the King’s cabinet. No one offered to raise
the arras for him. Guise lifted his own right arm to help himself
at the same time looking half-round at the archers who were near
him. At that moment, a dagger was buried in his breast, up to
the very hilt. The blow was delivered by Montsery, from behind.
The Duke let fall his hand to the pommel of his sword, when one
assassin clung to his legs, a second, also from behind, stabbed him
in the neck; while a third passed his weapon through the Duke’s
ribs.</p>

<p>Guise’s first cry was, “Ho, friends!” His second, as Sarine
ran him through the lower part of the back, was, “Mercy, Jesus!”
He struggled faintly across the chamber, bleeding from a dozen
wounds, in every one of which sat death. The murderers hacked
at him as he staggered, and wildly yet feebly fought. All paused
for a moment, when he had reached the extreme end of the room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
where he again attempted to raise his sword; but in the act he
rolled over, stone dead, at the foot of the bed of Henri III.</p>

<p>At that moment the tapestry was raised, and the king, whispering
“Is it done?” approached the body, moodily remarking as he
gazed upon it, “He looks greater than he did when living.” Upon
the person of the duke was found a manuscript memorandum, in
these words:—“To maintain a war in France, I should require
700,000 livres per month.” This memorandum served in the
king’s mind as a justification of the murder just committed by
his orders. The body was then unceremoniously rolled up in the
Turkey carpet on which it had fallen, was covered with quick
lime, and flung into the Loire. Some maimed rites were previously
performed over it by Dourgin the royal chaplain, who
could not mutter the <i>De Profundis</i> without a running and terrified
commentary of “Christ!—the awful sight!” Guise’s second
cardinal-brother and the Archbishop of Lyons were murdered on
the following day; but the lesser victims were forgotten in the
fate which had fallen upon the more illustrious, yet certainly more
guilty personages.</p>

<p>The widow of Guise, soon after the dread event, gave birth to
a son, subsequently the Chevalier Louis de Guise. “The boy,”
said the bereaved lady, “came into the world with his hands
clasped, as if praying for vengeance on the assassins of his father.”
Every male member of the family whom the king could reach
was now subjected to arrest. The young heir of <i>Balafré</i>, Charles,
now fourth Duke of Guise, was now placed in close restriction in
the Castle of Tours, where, sleeping or waking, four living eyes
unceasingly watched him—<i>voire même allant â la garderobe</i>—but
which eyes he managed to elude nevertheless.</p>

<p>In the meantime Rome excommunicated the murderer of her
champion. Paris put on mourning; officials were placed in the
street to strip and scourge even ladies who ventured to appear
without some sign of sorrow. Wax effigies of the king were
brought into the churches, and frantically stabbed by the priests
at the altar. The priests then solemnly paraded the streets, chanting
as they went, “May God extinguish the Valois!”</p>

<p>The whole city broke into insurrection, and the brother of
Guise, the Duke de Mayenne, placed himself at the head of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
“league,” whose object was the deposing of the king, and the
transferring of the crown to a child of Lorraine. In the contest
which ensued, Valois and Navarre united against the Guisards,
and carried victory with them wherever they raised their banners.
The exultation of Henri III. was only mitigated by the repeated
Papal summonses received by him to repair to Rome, and there
answer for his crime.</p>

<p>Henri of Navarre induced him to rather think of gaining Paris
than of mollifying the Pope; and he was so occupied when the
double vengeance of the church and the house of Guise overtook
him in the very moment of victory.</p>

<p>The Duchess de Montpensier, sister of the slaughtered duke,
had made no secret of her intentions to have public revenge for
the deed privately committed, whereby she had lost a brother.
There was precaution enough taken that she should not approach
the royal army or the king’s quarters; but a woman and a priest
rendered all precautions futile. The somewhat gay duchess was
on unusually intimate terms with a young monk, named Jacques
Clement. This good Brother was a fanatic zealot for his church,
and a rather too ardent admirer of the duchess, who turned both
sentiments to her own especial purpose. She whispered in his
ears a promise, to secure the fulfilment of which, he received with
furious haste, the knife which was placed in his hands by the
handsomest woman in France. It is said that knife is still preserved,
a precious treasure, at Rome.</p>

<p>However this may be, on the 1st of August, 1589, the young
Brother, with a weapon hid in the folds of his monkish gaberdine,
and with a letter in his hand, sought and obtained access to the
king. He went straightforward to his butcher’s work, and had
scarcely passed beneath the roof of the royal tent before he
had buried the steel deep in the monarch’s bosom. He turned
to fly with hot haste to the lady from whom he had received his
commission; but a dozen swords and pikes thrust life out of him
ere he had made three steps in the direction of his promised
recompence.</p>

<p>She who had engaged herself to pay for the crime cared for
neither victim. She screamed indeed, but it was with a hysteric
joy that threatened to slay her, and which was only allayed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
thought that the last King of the Valois race did not know that
he had died by a dagger directed by a sister of Guise.</p>

<p>In testimony of her exultation she distributed green scarfs, the
color of Lorraine, to the people of Paris. She brought up from
the provinces the mother of Clement, to whom was accorded the
distinction of a triumphal entry. Priests and people worshipped
the mother of the assassin as she passed wonderingly on her way;
and they blasphemously saluted her with the chanted words,
“Blessed be the womb that bare him, and the paps that gave him
suck.” She was led to the seat of honor at the table of Guise,
and Rome sheltered the infamy of the assassin, and revealed its
own, by pronouncing his work to be a god-like act. By authority
of the Vatican, medals were struck in memory and honor of the
dead; but the Huguenots who read thereon the murderer’s profession
and name—<i>Frère Jacques Clement</i>—ingeniously discovered
therein the anagrammatic interpretation “<i>C’est l’enfer qui
m’a crée</i>”—“It is hell that created me.”</p>

<p>The last Valois, with his last breath, had named the Protestant
Henri of Navarre as his legal successor to the throne; but between
Henri and his inheritance there stood Rome and the Guise faction.
Then ensued the successive wars of the League, during which the
heavy Mayenne suffered successive defeats at the hands of Henri of
the snowy plume. While the contest was raging, the people trusted
to the pulpits for their intelligence from the scene of action. From
those pulpits was daily uttered more mendacity in one hour than
finds expression in all the horse-fairs of the United Kingdom in a
year. When famine decimated those who lived within the walls,
the people were reduced to live upon a paste made from human
bones, and which they called “Madame de Montpensier’s cake.”</p>

<p>Henri of Navarre, their deliverer, did not arrive before the gates
of Paris without trouble. In 1521, Charles of Guise, the young
Duke, had escaped most gallantly, in open day, from the Castle of
Tours, by sliding from the ramparts, down a rope, which simply
blistered his hands and made a rent in his hose. He was speedily
accoutred and in the field, with Spain in his rear to help him.
Now, he was making a dash at Henri’s person; and, anon, leaping
from his camp-bed to escape him. At other times he was idle,
while his uncle Mayenne pursued the cherished object of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
house—that crown which was receding from them more swiftly
than ever. For the alert Bourbon, the slow and hard-drinking
Mayenne was no match. The latter thought once to catch the
former in his lady’s bower, but the wakeful lover was gayly galloping
back to his quarters before the trumpets of Mayenne had
sounded to “boot and saddle.” “Mayenne,” said the Pope, “sits
longer at table than Henri lies in bed.”</p>

<p>The gates of Paris were open to Henri on the 21st of March,
1591. Old Cardinal Pellevi died of disgust and indignation, on
hearing of the fact. The Duchess of Montpensier, after tearing
her hair, and threatening to swoon, prudently concluded, with
Henry IV., not only her own peace, but that of her family. The
chief members of the house of Guise were admitted into places of
great trust, to the injury of more deserving individuals. The
young Duke de Guise affected a superabundant loyalty. In return,
the King not only gave him the government of several chief
towns, but out of compliment to him forbade the exercise of Protestant
worship within the limits of the Duke’s government! Such
conduct was natural to a King, who to secure his throne had
abandoned his faith; who lightly said that he had no cannon so
powerful as the canon of the mass, and who was destitute of most
virtues save courage and good-nature. The latter was abused by
those on whom it was lavished; and the various assaults upon his
life were supposed to be directed by those very Guises, on whom
he had showered places, pensions, and pardons, which they were
constantly needing and continually deriding.</p>

<p>The young Duke of Guise enjoyed, among other appointments,
that of Governor of Marseilles. He was light-hearted, selfish,
vain, and cruel. He hanged his own old partisans in the city, as
enemies to the king; and he made his name for ever infamous by
the seduction of the beautiful and noble orphan-girl, Marcelle de
Castellane, whom he afterward basely abandoned, and left to die
of hunger. He sent her a few broad pieces by the hands of a
lacquey; but the tardy charity was spurned, and the poor victim
died. He had little time to think of her at the brilliant court of
the first Bourbon, where he and those of his house struggled to
maintain a reputation which had now little to support it, but the
memories of the past—and many of those were hardly worth appealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
to. He was a mere fine gentleman, bold withal, and therewith
intriguing; ever hoping that the fortunes of his house might
once more turn and bring it near a throne, and in the meantime,
making himself remarkable for his vanity, his airs of greatness,
and his affectation. Brave as he was, he left his brothers, the
cardinal and chevalier, to draw their swords and settle the quarrels
which were constantly raging on disputed questions touching the
assumed Majesty of the House of Guise.</p>

<p>The streets of Paris formed the stage on which these bloody
tragedies were played, but they, and all other pretensions, were
suppressed by that irresistible putter-down of such nuisances—the
Cardinal de Richelieu. He used the sword of Guise as long as it
was needed, but when Charles became troublesome the Cardinal
not only banished him, but wounded the pride of his family by
placing garrisons in the hitherto sovereign duchy of Lorraine.
When Cardinal Fleury subsequently annexed Lorraine itself to
the territory of France, the Guises thought the world was at an
end. The universe, however, survived the shock.</p>

<p>Duke Charles died in exile at Cune, near Sienne, in the year
1640. Of his ten children by the Duchess de Joyeuse, he left five
surviving. He was succeeded by Henri, the eldest, who was bishop
and cardinal. He had been raised to the episcopate while yet in
the arms of his wet-nurse; and he was in frocks when on his long
curls was placed the scarlet hat of a cardinal. He was twenty
years of age when he became Duke of Guise. He at once flung
away all he possessed of his religious profession—its dress and
titles, and walked abroad, spurs on his heels, a plume in his cap,
and a long sword and a bad heart between!</p>

<p>The whole life of this chivalrous scoundrel was a romance, no
portion of which reflects any credit on the hero. He had scarcely
reached the age of manhood, when he entered into a contract of
marriage with the beautiful Anne of Gonzaga. He signed the
compact, not in ink, but with his own blood, calling Heaven to
witness, the while, that he would never address a vow to any other
lady. The breath of perjury had scarcely passed his lips when he
married the Countess of Bossu, and he immediately abandoned
<i>her</i> to sun himself in the eyes of Mademoiselle de Pons—an imperious
mistress, who squandered the property he lavished on her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
and boxed the ex-cardinal’s ears, when he attempted, with degrading
humility, to remonstrate with her for bringing down ruin upon
his estate.</p>

<p>He was as disloyal to his King as to his “lady;” he tampered
with rebellion, was sentenced to death, and was pardoned. But a
state of decent tranquillity agreed ill with his constitution. To
keep that and his nerves from rusting, he one day drew his sword
in the street, upon the son of Coligny, whose presence seemed a
reproach to him, and whom he slew on the spot. He wiped his
bloody rapier on his mantle, and betook himself for a season to
Rome, where he intrigued skilfully, but fruitlessly, in order to obtain
the tiara for the brother of Mazarin. Apathy would now
have descended upon him, but for a voice from the city of Naples,
which made his swelling heart beat with a violence that almost
threatened to kill.</p>

<p>Masaniello had just concluded his brief and mad career. The
Neapolitans were not, on that account, disposed to submit again to
Spain. They were casting about for a King, when Guise presented
himself. This was in the year 1647. He left France in a frail
felucca, with a score of bold adventurers wearing the colors of
Lorraine, intertwined with “buff,” in compliment to the Duke’s
mistress. The Church blessed the enterprise. The skiff sped
unharmed through howling storms and thundering Spanish fleets;
and when the Duke stepped ashore at Naples, and mounted a
charger, the shouting populace who preceded him, burnt incense
before the new-comer, as if he had been a coming god.</p>

<p>For love and bravery, this Guise was unequalled. He conquered
all his foes, and made vows to all the ladies. In love he
lost, however, all the fruits of bravery. Naples was but a mock
Sardanapalian court, when the Spaniards at length mustered
strongly enough to attack the new, bold, but enervated King.
They took him captive, and held him, during four years, a prisoner
in Spain. He gained liberty by a double lie, the common coin of
Guise. He promised to reveal to the Court of Madrid the secrets
of the Court of Paris; and bound himself by bond and oath never
to renew his attempt on Naples. His double knavery, however,
brought him no profit. At length, fortune seeming to disregard
the greatness of his once highly-favored house, this restless reprobate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
gradually sunk into a mere court beau, passing his time in
powdering his peruke, defaming reputations, and paying profane
praise to the patched and painted ladies of the palace. He died
before old age, like most of the princes of his house: and in his
fiftieth year this childless man left his dignity and an evil name to
his nephew, Louis Joseph.</p>

<p>The sixth Duke bore his greatness meekly and briefly. He
was a kind-hearted gentleman, whose career of unobtrusive usefulness
was cut short by small-pox in 1671. When he died, there
lay in the next chamber an infant in the cradle. This was his little
son Joseph, not yet twelve months old, and all unconscious of his
loss, in a father; or of his gain, in a somewhat dilapidated coronet.
On his young brow that symbol of his earthly rank rested during
only four years. The little Noble then fell a victim to the disease
which had carried off his sire, and made of himself a Duke—the
last, the youngest, the most innocent, and the happiest of the race.</p>

<p>During a greater portion of the career of the Dukes, priest and
swordsman in the family had stood side by side, each menacing to
the throne; the one in knightly armor, the other in the dread panoply
of the Church. Of the seven ducal chieftains of the house,
there is only one who can be said to have left behind him a reputation
for harmlessness; and perhaps that was because he lived at
a time when he had not the power to be offensive. The boy on
the mule, in 1506, and the child in the cradle, in 1676, are two
pleasant extremes of a line where all between is, indeed, fearfully
attractive, but of that quality also which might make not only men
but angels weep.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the Dukes of Guise played for a high
prize; and lost it. More than once, however, they were on the
very point of grasping the attractive but delusive prize. If they
were so near triumph, it was chiefly through the co-operation of
their respective brothers, the proud and able Cardinals. The
Dukes were representatives of brute force; the Cardinals, of that
which is far stronger, power of intellect. The former often spoiled
their cause by being demonstrative. The latter never trusted to
words when silver served their purpose equally well. When they
<i>did</i> speak, it was with effective brevity. We read of a Lacedemonian
who was fined for employing three words to express what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
might have been as effectually stated in two. No churchman of
the house of Guise ever committed the fault of the Lacedemonian.</p>

<p>Cardinal John of Lorraine was the brother of the first Duke
Claude. When the latter was a boy, riding his mule into France,
John was the young Bishop-coadjutor of Metz. He was little
more than two years old when he was first appointed to this responsible
office. He was a Cardinal before he was out of his
teens; and in his own person was possessed of twelve bishoprics
and archbishoprics. Of these, however, he modestly retained but
three, namely, Toul, Narbonne, and Alby—as they alone happened
to return revenues worth acceptance. Not that he was
selfish, seeing that he subsequently applied for, and received the
Archbishopric of Rheims, which he kindly held for his nephew
Charles, who was titular thereof, at the experienced age of ten.
His revenues were enormous, and he was for ever in debt. He
was one of the most skilful negotiators of his time; but whether
deputed to emperor or pope, he was seldom able to commence his
journey until he had put in pledge three or four towns, in order
to raise money to defray his expenses. His zeal for what he understood
as religion was manifested during the short but bloody
campaign against the Protestants of Alsatia, where he accompanied
his brother. At the side of the Cardinal, on the field of
battle, stood the Apostolic Commissary, and a staff of priestly
aides-de-camp. While some of these encouraged the orthodox
troops to charge the Huguenots, the principal personages kept
their hands raised to Heaven; and when the pennons of the army
of Reformers had all gone down before the double cross of Lorraine,
the Cardinal and his ecclesiastical staff rode to the church
of St. Nicholas and sang <i>Te Deum laudamus</i>.</p>

<p>The chivalrous Cardinal was another man in his residence of
the Hotel de Cluny. Of this monastery he made a mansion, in
which a Sybarite might have dwelt without complaining. It was
embellished, decorated, and furnished with a gorgeousness that had
its source at once in his blind prodigality, his taste for the arts,
and his familiar patronage of artists. The only thing not to be
found in this celebrated mansion was the example of a good life.
But how <i>could</i> this example be found in a prelate who assumed
and executed the office of instructing the maids of honor in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
delicate duties. Do Thou says it was an occupation for which he
was pre-eminently fitted; and Brantome pauses, in his gay illustrations
of the truth of this assertion, to remark with indignation,
that if the daughters of noble houses arrived at court, endowed
with every maiden virtue, Cardinal John was the man to despoil
them of their dowry.</p>

<p>He was, nevertheless, not deficient in tastes and pursuits of a
refined nature. He was learned himself, and he loved learning
in others. His purse, when there was anything in it, was at the
service of poor scholars and of sages with great purposes in view.
He who deemed the slaughter of Protestant peasants a thing to
thank God for, had something like a heart for <i>clever</i> sneerers at
Papistry and also for Protestants of talent. Thus he pleaded the
cause of the amphibious Erasmus, extended his protection to the
evangelical Clement Marot, and laughed and drank with Rabelais,
the caustic curé of Meudon. He was, moreover, the boon companion
of Francis I., a man far less worthy of his intimacy than
the equivocating Erasmus, the gentle Marot, or roystering Rabelais,
who painted the manners of the court and church of his day,
in his compound characters of Gargantua and Panurge.</p>

<p>He was a liberal giver, but he gave with an ostentation for
which there is no warrant in the gospel. At one period of his
life he walked abroad with a game-bag full of crowns slung from
his neck. On passing beggars he bestowed, without counting, a
rich alms, requesting prayers in return. He was known as the
“game-bag Cardinal.” On one occasion, when giving largesse to
a blind mendicant in Rome, the latter was so astonished at the
amount of the gift, that, pointing to the giver, he exclaimed, “If
thou art not Jesus Christ, thou art John of Lorraine.”</p>

<p>He was bold in his gallantry. When sent by Francis I. to
negotiate some political business with the pope, he passed through
Piedmont, where he was for a while the guest of the Duke and
Duchess of Savoy. The duchess, on the cardinal being presented,
gravely offered her hand (she was a Portuguese princess) to be
kissed. John of Lorraine, however, would not stoop so low, and
made for her lips. A struggle ensued, which was maintained with
rude persistance on one side, and with haughty and offended vigor
on the other, until her highness’s head, being firmly grasped within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
his eminence’s arm, the cardinal kissed the ruffled princess two or
three times on the mouth, and then, with an exultant laugh, released
her.</p>

<p>The second cardinal of this branch, Charles of Lorraine, was
brother of the second duke. He was the greatest man of his
family, and the most powerful of his age. His ambition was to
administer the finances of France, and he did so during three
reigns, with an annual excess of expenditure over income, of two
millions and a half. He was rather dishonest than incapable.
His enemies threatened to make him account; he silenced them
with the sound of the tocsin of St. Bartholomew, and when the
slaughter was over he merrily asked for the presence of the accusers
who had intended to make him refund.</p>

<p>He was an accomplished hypocrite, and at heart a religious
reformer. At last he acknowledged to the leaders of the reformatory
movement, whom he admitted to his familiarity, that the
Reformation was necessary and warrantable; and yet policy made
of him the most savage enemy that Protestantism ever had in
France. He urged on the king to burn noble heretics rather than
the common people; and when Henri was touched with compassion,
in his dying moments, for some Protestant prisoners capitally
condemned, the cardinal told him that the feeling came of the
devil, and that it was better they should perish. And they
perished.</p>

<p>He introduced the Inquisition into France, and was made Grand
Inquisitor at the moment the country was rejoicing for the recovery
of Calais from the English. And this was the man who, at
the Council of Trent, advocated the celebration of divine worship
in the vernacular tongue. He was the friend of liberty to the
Gallican church, but he took the other side on finding that liberal
advocacy periled his chances of being pope. The living pope
used and abused him. “I am scandalized,” said his holiness, “at
finding you still in the enjoyment of the revenues of so many
sees.” “I would resign them all,” said the cardinal, “for a single
bishopric.” “Which bishopric?” asked the pope. “Marry!”
exclaimed Cardinal Charles, “the bishopric of Rome.”</p>

<p>He was as haughty as he was aspiring. The Guise had induced
the weak Anthony of Navarre to turn Romanist; but the cardinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
did not treat that king with more courtesy on that account. One
frosty morning, not only did the princely priest keep the mountain
king tarrying at his garden gate for an audience, but when he
went down to his majesty, he listened, all befurred as he was, to
the shivering monarch who humbly preferred his suit, cap in hand.</p>

<p>He was covetous and haughty, but he sometimes found his
match. His niece, Mary Stuart, had quarreled with Catherine
de Medicis, whose especial wrath had been excited by Mary’s
phrase applied to Catherine, of “The Florentine tradeswoman.”
The Scottish Queen resolved, after this quarrel, to repair to the
North. The cardinal was at her side when she was examining
her jewels, previously to their being packed up. He tenderly
remarked that the sea was dangerous, the jewels costly, and that
his niece could not do better than leave them in his keeping.
“Good uncle,” said the vivacious Mary, “I and my jewels travel
together. If I trust one to the sea, I may the other; and therewith,
<i>adieu!</i>” The cardinal bit his lips and blessed her.</p>

<p>Ranke is puzzled where to find the principal author of the massacre
of St. Bartholomew. There is no difficulty in the matter.
The Guises had appealed to the chances of battle to overcome
their chief adversaries in the kingdom. But for every Huguenot
father slain, there arose as many filial avengers as he had sons.
The causes of quarrel were individual as well as general. A Huguenot
had slain the second Duke, and his widow was determined
to be avenged. The Cardinal was wroth with the King for retaining
Protestant archers in his body-guard. The archers took
an unclean vengeance, and defiled the pulpit in the Chapel Royal,
wherefrom the Cardinal was accustomed to denounce the doctrine
of their teachers. His Eminence formed the confederacy by
which it was resolved to destroy the enemy at a blow. To the
general causes, I need not allude. The plot itself was formed in
Oliver Clisson’s house, in Paris, known as “the Hotel of Mercy.”
But the representatives of Rome and Spain, united with those of
France, met upon the frontier, and there made the final arrangements
which were followed by such terrible consequences. When
the stupendous deed was being done, the Cardinal was absent from
France; but he fairly took upon himself the guilt, when he conferred
the hand of his illegitimate daughter Anne d’Arne on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
officer Besme whose dagger had given the <i>first</i> mortal stab to
Coligny, the chief of the immolated victims of that dreadful day—and
Rome approved.</p>

<p>As a public controversialist he shone in his dispute with Beza.
Of his pride, we have an illustration in what is recorded of him in
the Council of Trent. The Spanish embassador had taken a place,
at mass, above that of the embassador from France. Thereupon,
the reverend Cardinal raised such a commotion in the cathedral,
and dwelt so loudly and strongly in expletives, that divine worship
was suspended, and the congregation broke up in most admired
disorder.</p>

<p>So at the coronation, in the Abbey of St. Dennis, of the Queen
of Charles IX. The poor, frail, Austrian Princess Elizabeth,
after being for hours on her knees, declared her incapacity for remaining
any longer without some material support from food or
wine. The Cardinal declared that such an irreligious innovation
was not to be thought of. He stoutly opposed, well-fed man that
he was, the supplying of any refreshment to the sinking Queen;
and it was only when he reflected that her life might be imperiled
that he consented to “the smallest quantity of something very
light,” being administered to her.</p>

<p>He was the only man of his family who was not possessed of the
knightly virtue of bravery. He was greatly afraid of being assassinated.
In council, he was uncourteous. Thus, he once accused
the famous Chancellor le Hospital of wishing to be “the cock
of the assembly,” and when the grave chancellor protested against
such language, the Cardinal qualified him as “an old ram.” It
may be added that, if he feared the dagger directed by private
vengeance, he believed himself protected by the guardianship of
Heaven, which more than once, as he averred, carried him off in
clouds and thunder, when assassins were seeking him. He was
wily enough to have said this, in order to deter all attempts at violence
directed against himself.</p>

<p>He died edifyingly, kissed Catherine de Medicis, and was believed
by the latter, to mysteriously haunt her, long after his
death. The real footing on which these two personages stood
has yet to be discovered by curious inquiries.</p>

<p>The Cardinal-brother of the third Duke, Louis of Lorraine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
loved good living, and was enabled at an early age to indulge his
propensities, out of the rich revenues which he derived from his
numerous ecclesiastical preferments. He held half a dozen abbeys
while he was yet in his cradle; and he was a bishop at the
mature age of eighteen. Just before his death, in 1598, when he
was about fifty years of age, he resigned his magnificent church
appointments, in favor of his nephew and namesake, who was to
be a future Cardinal at the side of the fourth Duke. Louis was
a man of ability and of wit. He chose a device for his own
shield of arms. It consisted of nine zeros, with this apt motto:
“Hoc per se nihil est; sed si minimum addideris, maximum erit,”
intending, it is said, to imply that man was nothing till grace was
given him. He was kindly-dispositioned, loved his ease, was
proud of his church, and had a passion for the bottle. That
was his religion. His private life was not marked by worse
traits than those that characterized his kinsmen in the priesthood.
He showed his affection for his mother after a truly filial
fashion, bequeathing to her all his estates, in trust, to pay his
debts.</p>

<p>The third duke had a second cardinal-brother, known as the
Cardinal de Guise, who was murdered by Henri III. He was
an intriguer; but as brave as any knight of his family. It was
long before the king could find men willing to strike a priest; and
when they <i>were</i> found, they approached him again and again, before
they could summon nerve wherewith to smite him. After all,
this second murder at Blois was effected by stratagem. The cardinal
was requested to accompany a messenger to the royal
presence. He complied with some misgiving, but when he found
himself in a dark corridor with four frowning soldiers, he understood
his doom; requested a few moments respite to collect his
thoughts; and then, enveloping his head in his outer robe, bade
them execute their bloody commission. He was instantly slain,
without offering resistance, or uttering a word.</p>

<p>This cardinal was father of five illegitimate sons, of whom the
most celebrated was the Baron of Ancerville, or, as he proudly
designated himself, “Bastard of Guise.”</p>

<p>By the side of the son of Balafré, Charles, the fourth duke,
there stood the last cardinal-brother who was able to serve his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
house, and whose character presents any circumstance of note.
This cardinal, if he loved anything more than the bottle, was
fondest of a battle. He characteristically lost his life by both.
He was present at the siege of St. Jean d’Angely, held by the
Protestants in the year 1621. It was on the 20th of May; and
the sun was shining with a power not known to our severe springs.
The cardinal fought like a fiend, and swore with more than fiendish
capacity. The time was high noon, and he himself was in the
noontide of his wondrous vigor, some thirty years of age. He
was laying about him in the bloody <i>mêlée</i> which occurred in the
suburb, when he paused for awhile, panting for breath and streaming
with perspiration. He called for a flask of red wine, which
he had scarcely quaffed when he was seized with raging fever,
which carried him off within a fortnight. He was so much more
addicted to knightly than to priestly pursuits, that, at the time of
his death, a negotiation was being carried on to procure from the
pope permission for the cardinal to give up to his lay-brother, the
Duc de Chevreuse, all his benefices, and to receive in return the
duke’s governorship of Auvergne. He was for ever in the saddle,
and never more happy than when he saw another before him with
a resolute foe firmly seated therein. He lived the life of a soldier
of fortune, or knight-errant; and when peace temporarily reigned,
he rode over the country with a band of followers, in search of
adventures, and always found them at the point of their swords.
He left the altar to draw on his boots, gird his sword to his hip,
and provoke his cousin De Nevers to a duel, by striking him in
the face. The indignant young noble regretted that the profession
of his insulter covered the latter with impunity, and recommended
him, at the same time, to abandon it, and to give De Nevers satisfaction.
“To the devil I have sent it already!” said the exemplary
cardinal, “when I flung off my frock, and belted on my
sword:” and the two kinsmen would have had their weapons in
each other’s throat, but for the royal officers, who checked their
Christian amusement.</p>

<p>This roystering cardinal, who was interred with more pomp
than if he had been a great saint, or a merely honest man, left
five children. Their mother was Charlotte des Escar. They
were recognised as legitimate, on allegation that their parents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
had been duly married, on papal dispensation. He was the
last of the cardinals, and was as good a soldier as any of the
knights.</p>

<p>Neither the pride nor the pretensions of the house expired with
either Dukes or Cardinals. There were members of the family
whose arrogance was all the greater because they were not of the
direct line of succession. Their great ambition in little things was
satisfied with the privilege granted to the ladies of Guise, namely,
the one which they held in common with royal princesses, at being
presented at court previous to their marriage. This ambition
gained for them, however, the hatred of the nobles and the princes
of the Church, and at length caused a miniature insurrection in
the palace at Versailles.</p>

<p>The occasion was the grand ball given in honor of the nuptials
of Marie Antoinette and the Dauphin. Louis XV. had announced
that he would open the brilliant scene by dancing a <i>minuet</i> with
Mlle. de Lorraine, sister of the Prince de Lambesc. The uproar
that ensued was terrific. The entire body of nobility protested
against such marked precedence being allowed to the lady in question.
The Archbishop of Rheims placed himself at the head of
the opposing movement; and, assembling the indignant peerage,
this successor of the Apostles, in company with his episcopal brother
from Noyon, came to the solemnly important resolution, that
between the princes of the blood-royal and <i>haute noblesse</i> there
could be no intermediate rank; and that Mlle. de Lorraine, consequently,
could not take precedence of the female members of the
aristocracy, who had been presented. A memorial was drawn up.
The entire nobility, old and new, signed it eagerly; and the King
was informed that if he did not rescind his determination, no lady
would dance at the ball after the <i>minuet</i> in question had been performed.
The King exerted himself to overcome the opposition:
but neither bishops nor baronesses would give way. The latter,
on the evening of the ball, walked about the grand apartments in
undress, expressed loudly their resolution not to dance, and received
archiepiscopal benison for their pious obstinacy. The matter
was finally arranged by compromise, whereby the Dauphin and
the Count d’Artois were to select partners among the nobility, and
not, as was <i>de rigueur</i>, according to the law of <i>minuets</i>, among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
princesses of their own rank. The hour for opening the famous
ball was retarded in order to give the female insurrectionists time
to dress, and ultimately all went off <i>à merveille!</i></p>

<p>With the Prince de Lambesc above-named, the race of Guise
disappeared altogether from the soil of France. He was colonel
of the cavalry regiment, <i>Royal Allemand</i>, which in 1789 came
into collision with the people. The Prince was engaged, with his
men, in dispersing a seditious mob. He struck one of the most
conspicuous of the rioters with the flat of his sword. This blow,
dealt by a Guise, was the first given in the great Revolution, and
it helped to deprive Louis XVI. of his crown. The Prince de
Lambesc was compelled to fly from the country, to escape the indignation
of the people. Nearly three centuries before, his great
ancestor, the boy of the mule, had entered the kingdom, and founded
a family which increased in numbers and power against the
throne, and against civil and religious liberty. And now, the sole
survivor of the many who had sprung from this branch of Lorraine,
as proud, too, as the greatest of his house, having raised his
finger against the freedom of the mob, was driven into exile, to
seek refuge for a time, and a grave for age, on the banks of the
distant Danube.</p>

<p>When Cardinal Fleury annexed the Duchy of Lorraine to
France, it was by arrangement with Austria; according to which,
Francis, Duke of Lorraine, received in exchange for his Duchy,
the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the hand of Maria Theresa.
Their heirs form the imperial house of Hapsburgh-Lorraine.
Such of my readers as have visited Nancy, the capital of old Lorraine,
will remember there the round chapel near what is left of
the old palace of the old Dukes. This chapel contains the tombs
of the principal of the twenty-nine Dukes who ruled sovereignly
in Lorraine. The expense of supporting the service and fabric,
altar and priests, connected with this chapel, is sustained entirely
by Austria. It is the only remnant preserved of the Lorraine
sovereignty of the olden time. The priests and <i>employes</i> in the
edifice speak of Hapsburgh-Lorraine as <i>their</i> house, to which they
owe exclusive homage. When I heard expression given to this
sentiment, I was standing in front of the tomb of that famous
etcher, old Jean Callot. The latter was a native of Nancy; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
I could almost fancy that his merry-looking lip curled with scorn
at the display of this rag of pride in behalf of the house of Lorraine.</p>

<p>With the story of part of that house I fear I may have detained
the reader too long. I will tell more briefly the shifting fortunes
of a material house, the knightly edifice of Rambouillet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">Rambouillet</span> is an old château where feudal knights once
lived like little kings. In its gardens Euphuism reigned supreme.
It is a palace, in whose chambers monarchs have feasted, and at
whose gates they have asked, when fugitives, for water and a crust
of bread. It commenced its career as a cradle of knights; it is
finishing it as an asylum for the orphan children of warriors. The
commencement and finale are not unworthy of one another; but,
between the two, there have been some less appropriate disposals
of this old chevalier’s residence. For a short period it was something
between Hampton Court and Rosherville. In the very place
where the canons of the Sainte Chapelle were privileged to kiss
the cheeks of the Duchess of Burgundy, the denizens of the Faubourg
St. Antoine could revel, if they could only pay for their
sport. Where the knightly D’Amaurys held their feudal state,
where King Francis followed the chase, and the Chevalier Florian
sang, and Penthièvre earned immortality by the practice of heavenly
virtues; where Louis enthroned Du Barry, and Napoleon
presided over councils, holding the destiny of thrones in the balance
of his will, there the sorriest mechanic had, with a few francs in
his hand, the right of entrance. The gayest <i>lorettes</i> of the capital
smoked their <i>cigarettes</i> where Julie D’Angennes fenced with love;
and the bower of queens and the refuge of an empress rang with
echoes, born of light-heartedness and lighter wine. Louis Napoleon
has, however, established a better order of things.</p>

<p>To a Norman chief, of knightly character, if not of knightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
title, and to the Norman tongue, <i>Rabouillet</i>, as it used to be
written, or the “Rabbit warren,” owes the name given to the
palace, about thirteen leagues from Paris, and to the village which
clusters around it. The former is now a quaint and confused pile,
the chief tower of which alone is now older than the days of
Hugues Capet. Some authors describe the range of buildings as
taking the form of a horseshoe; but the hoof would be indescribable
to which a shoe so shaped could be fittingly applied. The
changes and additions have been as much without end as without
taste. In its present architectural entirety it wears as motley an
aspect as Cœur de Lion might, were he to walk-down Pall Mall
with a modern <i>paletót</i> over his suit of complete steel.</p>

<p>The early masters of Rambouillet were a knightly, powerful
but uninteresting race. It is sufficient to record of the chivalric
D’Amaurys that they held it, to the satisfaction of few people but
themselves, from 1003 to 1317. Further record these sainted
proprietors require not. We will let them sleep on undisturbedly,
their arms crossed on their breast, in the peace of a well-merited
oblivion. <i>Requiescat!</i></p>

<p>One relic of the knightly days, however, survived to the period
of the first French Revolution. In the domain of Rambouillet
was the fief of Montorgueil. It was held by the prior of St.
Thomas d’Epernon, on the following service: the good prior was
bound to present himself yearly at the gate of Rambouillet, bareheaded,
with a garland on his brow, and mounted on a piebald
horse, touching whom it was bad service if the animal had not
four white feet.</p>

<p>The prior, fully armed like a knight, save that his white gloves
were of a delicate texture, carried a flask of wine at his saddle-bow.
In one hand he held a cake, to the making of which had
gone a bushel of flour—an equal measure of wheat was also the
fee of the lord. The officers of the latter examined narrowly into
the completeness of the service. If they pronounced it imperfect
the prior of Epernon was mulcted of the revenues of his fief for
the year ensuing.</p>

<p>In later days the ceremony lost much of its meaning; but down
to the period of its extinction, the wine, the cake, and the garland,
were never wanting; and the maidens of Rambouillet were said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
to be more exacting than the baronial knights themselves, from
whom many of them were descended. The festival was ever a
joyous one, as became a feudal lord, whose kitchen fireplace was
of such dimensions that a horseman might ride into it, and skim
the pot as he stood in his stirrups.</p>

<p>It is a singular thing that scarcely a monarch has had anything
to do with the knightly residence of Rambouillet, but mischance
has befallen him. The kings were unjust to the knights, and the
latter found for the former a Nemesis. Francis I. was hunting in
the woods of Rambouillet when he received the news of the death
of Henry VIII. that knight-sovereign, with whom he had struggled
on the Field of the Cloth of Gold. With the news, he received
a shock, which the decay sprung from various excesses
could not resist. He entered the chateau as the guest of the
Chevalier d’Angennes, in whose family the proprietorship then
resided. The chamber is still shown wherein he died, roaring
in agony, and leaving proof of its power over him, in the
pillow, which, in mingled rage and pain, he tore into strips with
his teeth.</p>

<p>The French author, Leon Gozlau, has given a full account of
the extraordinary ceremonies which took place in honor of Francis
after his death. In front of the bed on which lay the body of
the king, says M. Gozlau, “was erected an altar covered with
embroidered cloth; on this stood two gold candlesticks, bearing
two lights from candles of the whitest wax. The cardinals, prelates,
knights, gentlemen, and officers, whose duty it was to keep
watch, were stationed around the <i>catafalque</i>, seated on chairs of
cloth of gold. During the eleven days that the ceremony lasted,
the strictest etiquette of service was observed about the king, as
if he had been a living monarch in presence of his court. His
table was regularly laid out for dinner, by the side of his bed.
A cardinal blessed the food. A gentleman in waiting presented
the ewer to the figure of the dead king. A knight offered him
the cup mantling with wine: and another wiped his lips and fingers.
These functions, with many others, took place by the solemn and
subdued light of the funeral torches.”</p>

<p>The after ceremonies were quite as curious and extraordinarily
magnificent; but it is unnecessary to rest upon them. A king, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
not much better circumstances than Francis, just before his death,
slept in the castle for one night in the year 1588. It was a night
in May, and the knight proprietor Jean d’Angennes, was celebrating
the marriage of his daughter. The ceremony was interrupted
by a loud knocking at the castle gates. The wary Jean looked
first at the clamorous visitors through the wicket, whence he descried
Henri III. flurried, yet laughing, seated in an old carriage,
around which mustered dusty horsemen, grave cavaliers, and courtiers
scantily attired. Some had their points untrussed, and many
a knight was without his boots. An illustrious company, in fact;
but there were not two nobles in their united purses. Jean threw
open his portals to a king and his knights flying from De Guise.
The latter had got possession of Paris, and Henri and his friends
had escaped in order to establish the regal authority at Chartres.
The two great adversaries met at Blois: and after the assassination
of Guise, the king, with his knights and courtiers, gallopped
gayly past Rambouillet on his return to Paris, to profit by his
own wickedness, and the folly of his trusty and well-beloved cousin,
the duke.</p>

<p>Not long before this murder was committed, in 1588, the Hotel
Pisani in Paris was made jubilant by the birth of that Catherine
de Vivonnes, who was at once both lovely and learned. She lived
to found that school of lingual purists whose doings are so pleasantly
caricatured in the <i>Précieuses Ridicules</i> of Molière. Catherine
espoused that noble chevalier, Charles d’Angennes, Lord of
Rambouillet, who was made a marquis for her sake. The chevalier’s
lady looked upon marriage rather as a closing act of life than
otherwise; but then <i>hers</i> had been a busy youth. In her second
lustre she knew as many languages as a <i>lustrum</i> has years. Ere
her fourth had expired, her refined spirit and her active intellect
were disgusted and weary with the continual sameness and the
golden emptiness of the court. She cared little to render homage
to a most Christian king who disregarded the precepts of Christianity;
or to be sullied by homage from a monarch, which could
not be rendered without insult to a virtuous woman. Young
Catherine preferred, in the summer eve, to lie under the shadow
of her father’s trees, which once reared a world of leafy splendor
on the spot now occupied by the Palais Royal. There she read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
works coined by great minds. During the long winter evenings
she lay in stately ceremony upon her bed, an unseemly custom of
the period, and there, surrounded by chevaliers, wits, and philosophers,
enjoyed and encouraged the “cudgelling of brains.” At
her suggestion the old hotel was destroyed, and after her designs
a new one built; and when, in place of the old dark panelling, obscurely
seen by casements that kept out the light, she covered the
walls of her reception-rooms with sky-blue velvet, and welcomed
the sun to shine upon them, universal France admiringly pronounced
her mad, incontinently caught the infection, and broke out
into an incurable disease of fancy and good taste.</p>

<p>The fruit of the union above spoken of was abundant, but the
very jewel in that crown of children, the goodliest arrow in the
family quiver, was that Julie d’Angennes who shattered the hearts
of all the amorous chevaliers of France, and whose fame has, perhaps,
eclipsed that of her mother. Her childhood was passed at
the feet of the most eminent men in France; not merely aristocratic
knights, but as eminent wits and philosophers. By the side
of her cradle, Balzac enunciated his polished periods, and Marot
his tuneful rhymes, Voiture his conceits, and Vaugelas his learning.
She lay in the arms of Armand Duplessis, <i>then</i> almost as
innocent as the little angel who unconsciously smiled on that future
ruthless Cardinal de Richelieu; and her young ear heard the elevated
measure of Corneille’s “Melite.” To enumerate the circles
which was wont to assemble within the Hôtel Rambouillet in Paris,
or to loiter in the gardens and hills of the country château, whose
history I am sketching, would occupy more space than can be devoted
to such purpose. The circle comprised parties who were
hitherto respectively exclusive. Knights met citizen wits, to the
great edification of the former; and Rambouillet afforded an asylum
to the persecuted of all parties. They who resisted Henry IV.
found refuge within its hospitable walls, and many nobles and chevaliers
who survived the bloody oppression of Richelieu, sought
therein solace, and balm for their lacerated souls.</p>

<p>Above all, Madame de Rambouillet effected the social congregation
of the two sexes. Women were brought to encounter male
wits, sometimes to conquer, always to improve them. The title to
enter was, worth joined with ability. The etiquette was pedantically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
strict, as may be imagined by the case of Voiture, who, on
one occasion, after conducting Julie through a suite of rooms, kissed
her hand on parting from her, and was very near being expelled
for ever from Rambouillet, as the reward of his temerity. Voiture
subsequently went to Africa. On his return, he was not admitted
to the illustrious circle, but on condition that he narrated his adventures,
and to these the delighted assembly listened, all attired
as gods and goddesses, and gravely addressing each other as such.
Madame de Rambouillet presided over all as Diana, and the company
did her abundant homage. This, it is true, was for the
nonce; but there was a permanent travesty notwithstanding. It
was the weak point of this assembly that not only was every member
of it called by a feigned, generally a Greek, name, but the
same rule was applied to most men and things beyond it; nay, the
very oaths, for there were little expletives occasionally fired off in
ecstatic moments, were all by the heathen gods. Thus, as a sample,
France was <i>Greece</i>. Paris was <i>Athens</i>; and the Place Royale
was only known at Rambouillet as the <i>Place Dorique</i>. The
name of Madame de Rambouillet was <i>Arthemise</i>; that of Mademoiselle
de Scudery was <i>Aganippe</i>; and <i>Thessalonica</i> was the
purified cognomen of the Duchess de Tremouille. But out of
such childishness resulted great good, notwithstanding that Molière
laughed, and that the Academie derided Corneille and all others
of the innovating coterie. The times were coarse; things, whatever
they might be, were called by their names; ears polite experienced
offence, and at Rambouillet periphrasis was called upon to
express what the language otherwise conveyed offensively by the
medium of a single word. The idea was good, although it was
abused. Of its quality some conjecture may be formed by one or
two brief examples; and I may add, by the way, that the French
Academy ended by adopting many of the terms which it at first
refused to acknowledge. Popularity had been given to much of
the remainder, and thus a great portion of the vocabulary of Rambouillet
has become idiomatic French. “Modeste,” “friponne,”
and “secrète,” were names given to the under-garments of ladies,
which we now should not be afraid to specify. The sun was the
“amiable illuminator;” to “fulfil the desire which the chair had to
embrace you,” was simply to “sit down.” Horses were “plushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
coursers;” a carriage was “four cornices,” and chairmen were
“baptized mules.” A bed was the “old dreamer;” a hat, the
“buckler against weather;” to laugh was to “lose your gravity;”
dinner was the “meridional necessity;” the ear was the “organ,
or the gate of hearing;” and the “throne of modesty” was the polished
phrase for a fair young cheek. There is nothing very edifying
in all this, it is true; but the fashion set people thinking, and
good ensued. Old indelicacies disappeared, and the general, spoken
language was refined. If any greater mental purity ensued
from the change, I can scarcely give the credit of it to the party
at Rambouillet, for, with all their proclaimed refinement, their
nicety was of the kind described in the well-known maxim of the
Dean of St. Patrick.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable men in the circle of Rambouillet,
was the Marquis de Salles, Knight of St. Louis. He was the
second son of the Duke de Montausier, and subsequently inherited
the title. At the period of his father’s death, his mother found
herself with little dower but her title. She exerted herself, however,
courageously. She instructed her children herself, brought
them up in strict Huguenot principles, and afterward sent them to
the Calvinistic college at Sedan, where the young students were
famous for the arguments which they maintained against all comers—and
they were many—who sought to convert them to popery.
At an early age he acquired the profession of arms, the only vocation
for a young and portionless noble; and he shed his blood liberally
for a king who had no thanks to offer to a protestant. His
wit, refinement, and gallant bearing, made him a welcome guest at
Rambouillet, where his famous attachment to Julie, who was three
years his senior, gave matter for conversation to the whole of
France. Courageous himself, he loved courage in others, and his
love for Julie d’Angennes, was fired by the rare bravery exhibited
by her in tending a dying brother, the infectious nature of whose
disorder had made even his hired nurses desert him. In the
season of mourning, the whole court, led by royalty, went and did
homage to this pearl of sisters. But no admiration fell so sweetly
upon her ear as that whispered to her by the young Montausier.
One evidence of his chivalrous gallantry is yet extant. It is in
that renowned volume called the “Guirlande de Julie,” of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
he was the projector, and in the accomplishing of which, knights,
artists, and poets, lent their willing aid. It is superb vellum tome.
The frontispiece is the garland or wreath, from which the volume
takes its name. Each subsequent page presents one single flower
from this wreath (there are eighteen of them) with verses in honor
of Julie, composed by a dozen and a half of very insipid poets.
This volume was sold some years ago to Madame D’Uzes, a descendant
of the family, when its cost amounted to nearly one thousand
francs per page.</p>

<p>As everything was singular at Rambouillet, so of course was
the wooing of Julie and her knight. It was very “long a-doing,”
and we doubt if in the years of restrained ardor, of fabulous constancy,
of reserve, and sad yet pleasing anguish, the lover ever
dared to kiss the hand of his mistress, or even to speak of marriage,
but by a diplomatic paraphrase.</p>

<p>The goddesses of Rambouillet entertained an eloquent horror
of the gross indelicacy of such unions, for which Molière has
whipped them with a light but cutting scourge. The lover, moreover,
was a Huguenot. What was he to do? Like a true knight
he rushed to the field, was the hero of two brilliant campaigns,
and then wooed her as knight of half-a-dozen new orders, marechal-du-camp,
and Governor of Alsatia. The nymph was still
coy. The knight again buckled on his armor, and in the mêlée
at Dettingen was captured by the foe. After a two months’ detention,
he was ransomed by his mother, for two thousand crowns.
He re-entered Rambouillet lieutenant-general of the armies of
France, and he asked for the recompense of his fourteen years
of constancy and patience. Julie was shocked, for she only thought
how brief had been the period of their acquaintance. At length
the marquis made profession of Romanism, and thereby purchased
the double aid of the church and the throne. The king, the
queen, Cardinal Mazarin, and a host of less influential members,
besought her to relent, and the shy beauty at length reluctantly
surrendered. The marriage took place in 1645, and Julie was then
within sight of forty years of age. The young chevaliers and
wits had, you may be sure, much to say thereupon. The elder
<i>beaux esprit</i> looked admiringly; but a world of whispered wickedness
went on among them, nevertheless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>Montausier, for he now was duke and knight of the Holy Ghost,
became the reigning sovereign over the literary circle at Rambouillet,
during the declining years of Julie’s mother. Catherine
died in 1665, after a long retirement, and almost forgotten by the
sons of those whom she once delighted to honor. The most delicate
and the most difficult public employment ever held by the
duke, was that of governor to the dauphin. This office he filled
with singular ability. He selected Bossuet and Huet to instruct
the young prince in the theoretical wisdom of books, but the practical
teaching was imparted by himself. Many a morning saw
the governor and his pupil issue from the gilded gates of Versailles
to take a course of popular study among the cottages and peasantry
of the environs.</p>

<p>The heart of the true knight was shattered by the death of
Julie in 1671, at the age of sixty-four. He survived her nineteen
years. They were passed in sorrow, but also in continual
active usefulness; and when, at length, in 1690, the grave of his
beloved wife opened to receive him, Flechier pronounced a fitting
funeral oration over both.</p>

<p>The daughter and only surviving child of this distinguished
pair gave, with her hand, the lordship of Rambouillet to the Duc
d’Uzes, “Chevalier de l’ordre du Saint Esprit.” The knightly
family of D’Angennes had held it for three centuries. It was in
1706 destined to become royal. Louis XIV. then purchased it
for the Count of Toulouse, legitimatized son of himself and
Madame de Montespan. This count was knight and Grand Admiral
of France, at the age of five years. In 1704, he had just
completed his twenty-fifth year. He is famous for having encountered
the fleet commanded by Rook and Shovel, after the capture
of Gibraltar, and for having what the cautious Russian generals
call, “withdrawn out of range,” when he found himself on the
point of being utterly beaten. He behaved himself as bravely as
any knight could have done; but the government was not satisfied
with him. Pontchartrain, the Minister of Marine, recalled him,
sent him to Rambouillet, and left him there to shoot rabbits, and
like Diocletian, raise cabbages.</p>

<p>His son and successor, who was the great Duke de Penthièvre,
commenced his knighthood early. He was even made Grand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
Admiral of France before he knew salt water from fresh. He
studied naval tactics as Uncle Toby and the corporal fought their
old battles—namely, with toy batteries. In the duke’s case, it
was, moreover, with little vessels and small sailors all afloat in a
miniature fish-pond, made to represent, for the nonce, the mighty
and boundless deep. This grand admiral never ventured on the
ocean, but he bore himself chivalrously on the bloody field of
Dettingen, and he won imperishable laurels by his valor at Fontenoy.
For such scenes and their glories, however, the <i>preux
chevalier</i> cared but little. Ere the French <i>Te Deum</i> was sung
upon the last-named field, he hastened back to his happy
hearth at home. Rambouillet was then the abiding-place of all
the virtues. There the home-loving knight read the Scriptures
while the duchess sat at his side making garments for the poor.
There, the Chevalier Florian, his secretary and friend, meditated
those graceful rhymes and that harmonious prose, in which human
nature is in pretty masquerade, walking about like Watteau’s
figures, in vizors, brocades, high heels, and farthingales. When
the duchess died in child-birth, of her sixth child, her husband
withdrew to La Trappe where, among other ex-soldiers, he for
weeks prayed and slept upon the bare ground. Five out of his
children died early. Among them was the chivalrous but intemperate
Prince de Lamballe, who died soon after his union with
the unhappy princess who fell a victim to those fierce French
revolutionists—who were ordinarily so amiable, according to
M. Louis Blanc, that they were never so delighted as when they
could rescue a human being from death.</p>

<p>It was by permission of the duke, who refused to sell his house,
that Louis XV. built in the adjacent forest the hunting-lodge of
St. Hubert. An assemblage of kings, courtiers, knights and ladies
there met, at whose doings the good saint would have blushed,
could he have witnessed them. One night the glittering crowd
had galloped there for a carouse, when discovery was made that
the materials for supper had been forgotten, or left behind at
Versailles. “Let us go to Penthièvre!” was the universal cry;
but the king looked grave at the proposition. Hunger and the
universal opposition, however, overcame him. Forth the famished
revellers issued, and played a <i>reveillée</i> on the gates of Rambouillet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
loud enough to have startled the seven sleepers. “Penthièvre is
in bed!” said one. “He is conning his breviary!” sneered
another. “Gentlemen, he <i>is</i>, probably, at prayers,” said the king,
who, like an Athenian, could applaud the virtue which he failed
to practise. “Let us withdraw,” added the exemplary royal head
of the order of the Holy Ghost. “If we do,” remarked Madame
du Barry, “I shall die of hunger; let us knock again.” To the
storm which now beset the gates, the latter yielded; and as they
swung open, they disclosed the duke, who, girt in a white apron,
and with a ladle in his hand, received his visiters with the announcement
that he was engaged in helping to make soup for the
poor. The monarch and his followers declared that no poor could
be more in need of soup than they were. They accordingly
seized the welcome supply, devoured it with the appetite of those
for whom it was intended, and paid the grave knight who was
their host, in the false coin of pointless jokes. How that host
contrasted with his royal guest, may be seen in the fact told of
him, when a poor woman kissed his hand, and asked a favor as
he was passing in a religious procession. “In order of religion
before God,” said he, “I am your brother. In all other cases,
for ever your friend.” The Order of the Holy Ghost never had
a more enlightened member than he.</p>

<p>In 1785 Louis XVI. in some sort compelled him to part with
Rambouillet for sixteen million of francs. He retired to Eu,
taking with him the bodies of the dead he had loved when living.
There were nine of that silent company; and as the Duke
passed with them on his sad and silent way, the clouds wept over
them, and the people crowded the long line of road, paying their
homage in honest tears.</p>

<p>Then came that revolutionary deluge which swept from Rambouillet
the head of the order of the Holy Ghost, and the entire
chapter with him; and which dragged from the mead and the
dairy the queen and princesses, whose pastime it was to milk
the cows in fancy dresses. The Duke de Penthièvre died of the
Revolution, yet not through personal violence offered to himself.
The murder of his daughter-in-law, the Princess de Lamballe, was
the last fatal stroke; and he died forgiving her assassins and his
own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>During the first Republic there was nothing more warlike at
Rambouillet than the merino flocks which had been introduced by
Louis XVI. for the great benefit of his successors. A scene
of some interest occurred there in the last days of the empire.</p>

<p>On the 27th of March, 1814, the empress Maria Louisa with
the King of Rome in her arms, his silver-gray jacket bearing
those ribboned emblems of chivalry which may still be seen
upon it at the Louvre, sought shelter there, while she awaited the
issue of the bloody struggle which her own father was maintaining
against her husband. The empress passed three days at Rambouillet,
solacing her majestic anguish by angling for carp. Ultimately,
the Emperor of Austria entered the hall where his imperial
son-in-law had made so many Knights of the Legion of
Honor, to carry off his daughter and the disinherited heir. As
the three sat that night together before the wood-fire, the Arch-Duchess
Maria-Louisa talked about the teeth of the ex-king of
Rome, while two thousand Austrian soldiers kept watch about
the palace.</p>

<p>The gates had again to be open to a fugitive. On the last of
the “three glorious days” of July a poor, pale, palsied fugitive
rushed into the chateau, obtained, not easily, a glass of water and
a crust, and forthwith hurried on to meet captivity at last. This
was the Prince de Polignac. Two hours after he had left came
the old monarch Charles X., covered with dust, dropping tears
like rain, bewildered with past memories and present realities, and
loudly begging for food for the two “children of France,” the offspring
of his favorite son, the Duke de Berri. In his own palace
a king of France was compelled to surrender his own service
of plate, before the village would sell him bread in return.
When refreshed therewith, he had strength to abdicate in favor
of his son, the Duke d’Angoulême, who at once resigned in favor
of his nephew the Duke de Bordeaux; and this done, the whole
party passed by easy stages into an inglorious exile. With them
was extinguished the Order of the Holy Ghost; and never since
that day have the emblematic dove and star been seen on the
breast of any knight in France.</p>

<p>Louis Philippe would fain have appropriated Rambouillet to
himself; but the government assigned it to the nation, and let it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
to a phlegmatic German, who had an ambition to sleep on the bed
of kings, and could afford to pay for the gratification of his fancy.
It was on the expiration of his lease that the house and grounds
were made over to a company of speculators, who sadly desecrated
fair Julie’s throne. The present sovereign of France has given
it a worthy occupation. It is now an asylum and a school for the
children of the brave. It began as the cradle of knights; and the
orphans of those who were as brave as any of the chevaliers of
old now find a refuge at the old hearth of the Knights of Amaury.</p>

<p>I can well conclude, that, by this time, my readers may be
weary of foreign scenes and incidents, as we are of real personages.
May I venture then, for the sake of variety, to ask them
to accompany me “to the well-trod stage, anon?” There I will
treat, to the best of my poor ability, of Stage Knights generally;
and first, of the greatest of them all—Sir John Falstaff.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>



<p><span class="smcap large">Henry</span>, Earl of Richmond, always creates a favorable impression
on young people who see him, for the first time, without
knowing much about him, previously, at the end of Shakespeare’s
tragedy of Richard the Third. This is a far higher degree of
favor than he merited, for Henry was a very indifferent personage
indeed. On the other hand Sir John Falstaff has had injustice
done him by the actors; and of Shakespeare’s jolly old <i>gentleman</i>
they have made what, down to Macklin’s times, they made of
Shylock, a mere mountebank.</p>

<p>In the very first scene, in the first part of Henry IV., when the
Prince and Sir John appear in company, the knight is, by far, a
more accomplished gentleman than the heir-apparent, for he speaks
more refinedly of phrase, and indeed seldom indulges in scurrilous
epithets, until provoked. Strong language is the result of his infirmity
of nature, not of vicious inclination. Lord Castlereagh
was not accounted the less a gentleman for using, as he <i>could</i> do,
very unsavory phrases occasionally.</p>

<p>The Prince is the first to rail, while Sir John shows his breeding
and, I will add, his reading, by quoting poetry. But, if he is
poetical, still more is he philosophical. How gravely does he beseech
Hal to trouble him no more with vanity! And what a censure
does the heavy philosopher fling at the King’s son, when he
tells the latter that he was hurt to hear the wise remarks of a lord
of the council touching that son’s conduct! The fault of the
knight is, that he is easily led away into evil; a common weakness
with good-natured people. It is only since he held fellowship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
with the Prince, that the fat follower of the latter had become
knowing in evil, and Heaven help him, little better, as he says,
than one of the wicked. Nay, he has enough of orthodoxy left
to elicit praise, even from the editor of the <i>Record</i>. “O, if a man
were to be saved by merit,” he exclaims, “what hole in hell were
hot enough to hold him!”</p>

<p>He robs on the highway, it will be said. Well, let us not be
too ready to doubt his gentility on that account. There was many
a noble cut-purse in the grand gallery at Versailles, when it was
most crowded; and George Prince of Wales once nearly lost the
diamond-hilt of his sword, at one of his royal mother’s “drawing-rooms.”
The offenders here were but petty-larceny rascals, compared
with Falstaff on the highway. That he defrauded the
King’s exchequer is, certainly, not to be denied. But again, let
us not be too hasty to condemn good men with little foibles.
Recollect that St. Francis de Sales very often cheated at cards.</p>

<p>Robbery on the highway was, after all, only, as I may call it,
a rag of knighthood. Falstaff robbed in good company. It was
his vocation. It was the fashion. It was an aristocratic pastime.
Young blood would have it so; and Sir John was a boy with the
boys. In more recent times, your young noble, of small wit and
too ample leisure, flings stale eggs at unsuspecting citizens, makes
a hell of his quarters, if he be military, and breaks the necks of
stage-managers.</p>

<p>Sir John was, doubtless, one of those of whom Gadshill speaks
as doing the robbing profession some grace for mere sport’s sake.
“I am joined,” says Gadshill, “with no foot land-rakers, no long-staff
sixpenny strikers, none of those mad mustachio, purple-hued,
malt-worms, but with nobility, and sanguinity; burgomasters, and
great mongers.” Indeed, it is matter of fact that, there were
graver, if not greater men than these among the noble thieves,
“who would, if matters were looked into, for their own credit-sake,
make all whole.” There was one at least who, for being a
highway robber, made none the worse justice, charged to administer
halters to poorer thieves.</p>

<p>But let us return to our old friend. Poor Sir John, I doubt if
he would have gone robbing, even in the Prince’s company, only
that he was bewitched by his Royal Highness’s social qualities.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
But even then, while patiently enduring all sorts of hard jokes,
he is really the Mentor of the party, and does not go to rob the
travellers without first seriously reminding the gentlemen of the
road, that it was a hanging matter. He would keep them from
wrong, but as they are resolved on evil commission he accompanies
them. He has explained the law, and he is not too proud to
share the profits.</p>

<p>He is brave, too, despite all his detractors! When the Prince
and Poins, in disguise, set upon the gentle robbers, as they are
sharing their booty, Falstaff is the only one who is described as
giving “a blow or two,” before he imitates “the rest,” and runs
away. When he attacked the travellers he was content to fight
his man; there were four to four. And as to the imaginative
description of the assault given by Falstaff, I believe it to have
been uttered in joke and gayety of heart. I have implicit faith
in the assertion, that he knew the disguised parties as well as
their mothers did. See how readily he detects the Prince and
Poins, when they are disguised as “drawers” at the inn in Eastcheap.
If Falstaff was right in the latter case, when he told the
Prince that he, Falstaff, was a gentleman, I think, too, he had as
sufficient authority for saying to Hal, “Thou <i>knowest</i> I am as
valiant as Hercules.” I can not believe otherwise of a man
whose taste was so little vitiated that he could at once detect
when there was “lime” in his sack, and who no sooner hears that
the state is in danger, than he suggests to the young Prince that
he <i>must</i> to court. His obesity may be suspected as not being the
fruit of much temperance, but there is a Cardinal Archbishop in
England who is the fattest man in the fifty-two counties, and why
may we not conclude in both cases, that it is as Falstaff says, and
that sighing and grief blow up a man like a bladder?</p>

<p>Then, only consider the reproof which Falstaff addresses to the
Prince, speaking in the character of King to that illustrious scapegrace.
Wisdom more austere, or graver condemnation of excess,
could hardly be uttered by the whole college of cardinals, at any
time. The prince is a mere plagiarist from the knight, and when
he accuses the latter of being given to licentious ways, with what
respectful humility does the old man plead guilty to his years, but
“saving your reverence,” not to the vices which are said to accompany
them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>Not that he is perfect, or would boast of being so. “He <i>has
had</i>,” he says touchingly, “a true faith and a good conscience, but
their date is out.” How ill is he requited by the Prince, in whose
service he has lost these jewels, when his Highness remarks, before
setting out to the field, “I’ll procure this fat rogue a charge
of foot, and I know his death will be a charge of fourscore.” And
this is said of one who has forgotten what the inside of a church
is like through keeping this Prince’s villanous company; till when,
he had been “as virtuously given as a gentleman need be.”
What he considers as the requisite practice of a gentleman, is
explained by Falstaff in his low estate, and not in the spirit
which moved him when he “lived well and in good compass.”</p>

<p>But there is a Nemesis at every man’s shoulder, and if Falstaff
was cavalierly careless enough to run up a score at the Boar’s
Head, and to accept even a present of Holland shirts, which he
ungratefully designates as “filthy dowlas,” the way in which he
was <i>dunned</i> must have been harsh to the feelings of a knight and
a gentleman. In reviewing his gallantries and his extravagances,
we must not, in justice to him, forget that he was a bachelor. If
he degraded himself, he inflicted misery on no Lady Falstaff at
home. Heroes have been buried, with whole nations for mourners,
whose offences in this worse respect have been forgotten.
Not that I would apologise for the knight’s familiarity with either
the Hostess or that remarkably nice young lady, Miss Dorothea
Tearsheet. I do not know what the private life of that Lord
Chief Justice may have been who was so very merciless in his
censure upon the knight; but I do know that there have been luminaries
as brilliant who have hidden their lights in very noisome
places and who had not Falstaff’s excuse.</p>

<p>I am as little embarrassed touching Sir John’s character as a
soldier, as I am about his morals. I do not indeed like to hear
him acknowledge that he has “misused the King’s press most
damnably,” or that he has pocketed “three hundred and odd
pounds” by illegally releasing a hundred and fifty men. But at
this very day practices much worse than this are of constant observance
in the Russian service, where officers and officials,
whose high-sounding names “exeunt in off,” rob the Czar daily,
and are decorated with the Order of St. Catherine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>In the field, I maintain that Falstaff is a hero. As for his catechism
on honor, so far from detracting from his reputation, it
seems to me to place him on an equality with that modern English
hero who said that his body trembled at the thought of the perils
into which his spirited soul was about to plunge him. Falstaff
did not <i>court</i> death. “God keep lead out of me,” is his reasonable
remark; “I need no more weight than mine own bowels!”
But the man who makes this prayer and comment was not afraid
to encounter death. “<i>I have led</i> my ragamuffins where they are
peppered.” He went then at their head. That there was hot
work in front of him is proved by what follows. “There’s but
three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and they are for the
town’s end, to beg during life!” A hundred and forty-seven men
killed out of a hundred and fifty-one; of the four who survived,
three are illustriously mutilated; while the bold soul who led
them on is alone unscathed! Why, it reminds us of Windham
and the Redan. It is Thermopylæ, with Leonidas surviving to
tell his own story.</p>

<p>His discretion is not to be taken as disproving his valor. He
fought Douglas, remember, and did not run away from him. He
found the Scot too much for him, it is true; and quietly dropped
down, as if dead. What then? When the Muscovite general fell
back so hurriedly from Eupatoria, how did he describe the movement?
“Having accomplished,” he said, “all that was expected,
the Russians <i>withdrew out of range</i>.” So, Sir John, with respect
to Douglas.</p>

<p>Nor would <i>some</i> Muscovite officers and gentlemen object to another
action of Falstaff’s. The knight it will be remembered with
regret, stabs the body of Hotspur, as the gallant Northumbrian
lies dead, or wounded, upon the field. Now, by this we may see
that Russia is not only some four centuries behind us in civilization.
The barbarous act of Falstaff was committed a score of
times over on the field of Inkerman. Many a gallant, breathing,
but helpless English soldier, received the mortal thrust which
they could not parry, from the hands of the Chevalier Ivan Falstaff,
who fought under the doubtful inspiration of St. Sergius. And,
moreover, there were men in authority there who virtually remarked
to these heroes what Prince Henry does to Sir John,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">“If a lie may do thee grace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll gild it with the happiest terms I have.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>That <i>our</i> Falstaff bore himself with credit on the field, is made
clear in spite of the incident of Hotspur. I do not pause to point
out the bearing of Morton’s answer, when Northumberland asks
him, “Didst thou come from Shrewsbury?”—“I <i>ran</i> from Shrewsbury,
my noble lord,” is the reply; confessing that he ran from a
foe, among whom Falstaff was a leader: I am more content to
rest on the verdict of so dignified yet unwilling a witness as the
Lord Chief Justice. It is quite conclusive. “Your day’s service
at Shrewsbury,” says my lord, “hath a little gilded over your
night’s exploit at Gadshill.” Nothing can be more satisfactory.
The bravery of Falstaff was the talk of the town.</p>

<p>When peace has come, or that Sir John has received permission
to return home, on urgent private affairs, he enters a little
into dissipation, it is true. He is not, however, guilty of such
excess as to materially injure his health; otherwise his page would
not have brought him so satisfactory a message from his doctor.
He may, perhaps, be also open to the charge of being too easily
taken by such white bait as he might find in the muslin of Eastcheap.
Heroes, however, have usually very inflammable hearts.
When Nelson was ashore, he immediately fell in love.</p>

<p>In spite of a trifle of rioting, the overflowing of animal spirits,
Falstaff is governed by the laws of good society. Jokes are fired
at him incessantly, but he takes them with good-humor, and repays
them with interest. “I am not only witty in myself,” he says,
“but the cause that wit is in other men.” Gregoire and La Bruyere
expressly define the great rule of conversation to be that, while
you exhibit your own powers, you should endeavor to elicit and encourage
those of your companions. What they put down as a canon,
Sir John had already, and long before, put in excellent practice.
He had wit enough to foil the Chief Justice, but he left to his
lordship ample opportunity to exhibit his own ability; and then
the compliment to the great judicial dignitary, that he was not yet
clean past his youth, although he had in him some relish of the
saltness of time—this, combined with the benevolent recommendation
that his lordship would have a reverend care of his health,
robs the latter personage of any prejudice he might have entertained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
against the knight. Indeed, it would be difficult to conceive how
the religiously-minded Lord Chief Justice could have entertained
prejudice against a gallant old gentleman who had lost his voice
with “hollaing” (his men to the charge), “and singing of anthems.”</p>

<p>Brave! there can be no question touching his bravery. And
if he does really rust a little at home, and impose a little upon
the weakness of the Hostess and other ladies, whom he weekly
woos to marry, and who find his gallantry and saucy promises
irresistible; he is ever ready for service. He does not look for
unlimited absence from scenes of danger. If he led his company
of three hundred and a half to death, and comes out scot-free
himself, he is by no means prepared to hang about town, inactive
for the remainder of the campaign. When he is appointed on
perilous enterprise with Prince John of Lancaster, he simply remarks,
with a complacency which is doubtless warranted by truth,
“There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head, but I am
thrust upon it. Well, I can not last for ever;” and, with this remark
buckled on to some satirical wit which he points at the Lord
Chief Justice, he sets forth cheerily on his mission, the gout in his
toe, and in his purse not more than seven groats and twopence.
He has a rouse and a riot at the Boar’s Head before he starts;
but nothing more disreputable seems to have occurred than one
might hear of at a modern club, before some old naval lion is hiccupped
on to deeds of daring. Besides, the knight is no hypocrite;
and he will not be accounted virtuous, like many of his
contemporaries, by “making courtesy and saying nothing.” Not,
on the other hand, that even in his moments of jolly relaxation,
he would be unseemly noisy. He can troll a merry catch, but, as
he says to a vulgarly roystering blade, “Pistol, I would be quiet.”
It has been thought unseemly that he should quarrel with and
even roughly chastise the “ancient” with whom he had been on
such very intimate terms. But such things happen in the best
society. At the famous Reform Club dinner, Sir James gave permission
to Sir Charles to go and make war; but, since that time,
Sir Charles, with words, instead of rapiers, has been poking his iron
into the ribs of Sir James, after the fashion of Falstaff and Pistol.</p>

<p>And so, as I have said, Sir John girds him for the battle. If
he did in his youth, hear the chimes at midnight, in company with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
Master Shallow, the lean, but light-living barrister of Clement’s
Inn, he did not waste his vigor. So great indeed is his renown
for this, and for the bravery which accompanies it, that no sooner
does the doughty Sir John Colville of the Dale meet him in single
combat, than Colville at once surrenders. The very idea of such
a hero being face to face with him impels him to give up his sword
at once. “I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that thought
yield me.” Was ever greater compliment paid to mortal hero?</p>

<p>Of this achievement Prince John most ungenerously says, that
it was more the effect of Colville’s courtesy than Falstaff’s deserving.
But, as the latter remarks, the young sober-blooded boy of a
prince does not love the knight; and “that’s no marvel,” exclaims
Falstaff, “he drinks no wine.” The teetotaler of those days disparaged
the deeds of a man who increased the sum of his country’s
glory. He was like a sour Anglo-Quaker, sneering down the
merit of a Crimean soldier. We do not, however, go so far as
Falstaff in his enthusiasm, when he exclaims that skill in the
weapon is nothing without sack. There is something in the remark,
nevertheless, as there is when Sir John subsequently says
in reference to his wits suffering by coming in dull contact with
obtuse Shallow. “It is certain,” says he, “that either wise bearing
or ignorant carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of
another; <i>therefore</i> let men take care of their company.” Victor
Hugo has manifestly condescended to plagiarize this sentiment,
and has said in one of his most remarkable works, that “On devient
vieux à force de regarder les vieux.”</p>

<p>And, to come to a conclusion, how unworthily is this gallant
soldier, merry companion, and profound philosopher, treated at last
by an old associate, Prince Hal, when king. Counting on the sacredness
of friendship, Sir John had borrowed from Master Shallow
a thousand pounds. He depended upon being able to repay
it out of the new monarch’s liberality, but when he salutes the
sovereign—very inopportunely, I confess—the latter, with a
cold-hearted and shameless ingratitude, declares that he does not
know the never-to-be-forgotten speaker. King Henry V. does
indeed promise—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For competence of life, I will allow you;</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">That lack of moans enforce yon not to evil;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>and departs, after intimating that the knight must not reside within
ten miles of court, and that royal favor will be restored to the
banished man, if merit authorize it.</p>

<p>“Be it your charge, my lord, to see performed the tenor of our
word,” says the King to the Chief Justice; and Falstaff, though
sorely wounded in feelings, is still not without hope. But see
what a royal word, or what <i>this</i> royal word is! The Monarch
has no sooner passed on his way, than the Chief Justice fulfils its
meaning, by ordering Sir John Falstaff and all his company to be
close-confined in the Fleet! The great dignitary does this with
as much hurried glee as we may conjecture Lord Campbell
would have had, in rendering the same service to Miss Agnes
Strickland, when the latter accused the judge of stealing her story
of Queen Eleanor of Provence.</p>

<p>However this may be, the royal ingratitude broke the proud
heart in the bosom of Sir John. He took to his bed, and never
smiled again. “The King has killed his heart,” is the bold assertion
of Dame Quickly, at a time when such an assertion might
have cost her her liberty, if not her life. How edifying too was
his end! He did not “babble o’ green fields.” Mr. Collier has
proved this, to the satisfaction of all Exeter Hall, who would
deem such light talk trifling. But he died arguing against “the
whore of Babylon,” which should make him find favor even with
Dr. Cumming, for it is a proof of the knight’s Protestantism—and
“Would I were with him,” exclaims honest lieutenant Bardolph,
with more earnestness than reverence—“Would I were with him,
wheresome’er he is; either in heaven or in hell.” If this has a
profane ring in it, let us think of the small education and the hard
life of him who uttered it. There was more profanity and terrible
blasphemy to boot, in the assertion of Prince Menschikoff, after
the death of the Czar Nicholas, namely, “that his late august master
might be seen in the skies blessing his armies on their way to
victory!” Decidedly, I prefer Bardolph to Menschikoff, and Falstaff
to both.</p>

<p>I am sorry that Queen Elizabeth had the bad taste to request
Shakespeare to represent “Falstaff in love.” The result is only
an Adelphi farce in five acts; in which the author, after all, has
made the knight far more respectable than that sorry fool, Ford.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
The “Wives” themselves are not much stronger in virtue than
Dorothea of Eastcheap, unless Sir John himself was mistaken in
them. Of Mrs. Ford, who holds her husband’s purse-strings, he
says, “I can construe the action of her familiar style,” and he tells
us what that manner was, pretty distinctly. When he writes to
Mrs. Page, he notices a common liking which exists in both, in
the words, “You love sack, and so do I.” The “Wives,” for mere
mischief’s sake, we will say, tempted the gallant old soldier. In
their presence he had left off swearing, praised woman’s modesty,
and gave such orderly and well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness,
that Mrs. Page thought, perhaps, that drinking sack, and, in
company with Mrs. Ford, talking familiarly with him, would not
tempt him to turn gallant toward them. This consequence <i>did</i>
follow; and then the sprightly Wives, in place of bidding their ridiculous
husbands cudgel him, come to the conclusion that “the
best way was to entertain him with hope,” till his wickedly raised
fire should have “melted him in his own grease.” A dangerous
process, ladies, depend upon it!</p>

<p>Then, what a sorry cur is that Master Ford who puts Falstaff
upon the way to seduce his own wife! Had other end come of it
than what did result, is there a jury even in Gotham, that would
have awarded Ford a farthing’s-worth of separation. Falstaff is
infinitely more refined than Ford or Page. Neither of these
noodles could have paid such sparkling compliments as the knight
pays to the lady. “Let the court of France show me such another!
I see how thine eyes would emulate the diamond; thou hast
the right-arched bent of the brow, that becomes the ship-tire, the
tire-valiant, or any tire of Venetian admittance!” Why this is a
prose Anacreontic! And if the speaker of it could offend once,
he did not merit to be allured again by hope to a greater punishment
than he had endured for his first offence.</p>

<p>For one of the great characteristics of Falstaff is his own sense
of seemliness. When he was nearly drowned by being tossed
from the buck-basket into the river, his prevalent and uneasy idea
was, how disgusting he should look if he were to swell—a mountain
of mummy! The Mantelini of Mr. Dickens borrowed from
Falstaff this aversion to a “demmed damp body.” It is <i>not</i>
pleasant!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>Once again, Sir John, though he could err, yet he was ashamed
of his offence. Otherwise, would he have confessed, as he did,
when recounting how the mock fairies had tormented him, “I was
three or four times in the thought they were not fairies, but the
<i>guiltiness of my mind</i>, the sudden surprise of my powers drove
the grossness of the foppery into a received belief.” How exquisitely
is this said! How does it raise the knight above the broad
farce of most of the other characters! How infinitely superior is
he to the two dolts of husbands who, after hearing the confession
of guilty intention against the honor of their wives, invite him to
spend a jolly evening in company with themselves and the ladies.
And so they—</p>

<p>This may be accounted too gross for probability; but worse than
this is in the memory of our yet surviving fathers. There was,
within such a memory, a case tried before Sir Elijah Impey, in
which Talleyrand was the defendant, against whom a husband
brought an action, the great statesman having robbed him of his
wife. The action was brought to the ordinary issue; and a few
weeks subsequently, plaintiff, defendant, judge, and lady, dined together
in the Prince’s residence at Paris.</p>

<p>Of Stage Falstaffs, Quin, according to all accounts, must have
been the best, provided only that he had a sufficiency of claret in
him, and the house an overflowing audience. Charles Kemble, I
verily believe, must have been the worst of stage Falstaffs. At
least, having seen him in the character, I can conscientiously assert
that I can not imagine a poorer Sir John. He dressed the character
well; but as for its “flavor,” it was as if you had the two
oyster-shells, <i>minus</i> the fat and juicy oyster. What a galaxy of
actors have shined or essayed to shine in this joyous but difficult
part! In Charles the Second’s days, Cartwright and Lacy, by
their acting in the first part of Henry IV., made Shakespeare popular,
when the fashion at Court was against him. Betterton acted
the same part in 1700, at Lincoln’s Inn Fields and the Haymarket.
Four years later, he played the Knight in the “Merry Wives;”
and in 1730, at Drury Lane, he and Mills took the part alternately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
and set dire dissension among the play-goers, as to their respective
merits.</p>

<p>Popular as Betterton was in this character, after he had grown
too stout for younger heroes, his manner of playing it was not
original; and his imitation was at second-hand. Ben Jonson had
seen it played in Dublin by Baker, a stone-mason. He was so
pleased with the representation, that he described the manner of
it, on his return to London, to Betterton, who, docile and modest
as usual, acknowledged that the mason’s conception was better than
his own, and adopted the Irish actor’s manner, accordingly.</p>

<p>Chetwood does not tell us how Baker played, but he shows us
how he studied, namely in the streets, while overlooking the men
who worked under him. “One day, two of his men who were
newly come to him, and were strangers to his habits, observing his
countenance, motion, gesture, and his talking to himself, imagined
their master was mad. Baker, seeing them neglect their work to
stare at him, bid them, in a hasty manner, mind their business.
The fellows went to work again, but still with an eye to their master.
The part Baker was rehearsing was Falstaff; and when he
came to the scene where Sir Walter Blunt was supposed to be
lying dead on the stage, gave a look at one of his new paviors, and
with his eye fixed upon him, muttered loud enough to be heard,
‘Who have we here? Sir Walter Blunt! There’s honor for
you.’ The fellow who was stooping, rose on the instant, and with
the help of his companion, bound poor Baker hand and foot, and
assisted by other people no wiser than themselves, they carried
him home in that condition, with a great mob at their heels.”</p>

<p>Estcourt’s Falstaff was flat and trifling, yet with a certain waggishness.
That of Harper was droll, but low and coarse. The
Falstaff of Evans seems to have been in the amorous scenes, as
offensive as Dowton in Major Sturgeon; and the humor was misplaced.
Accordingly, when we read in old Anthony Aston, that
“Betterton wanted the waggery of Estcourt, the drollery of Harper,
and the lasciviousness of Jack Evans,” we are disposed to
imagine that his Falstaff was none the worse for this trial of
wants.</p>

<p>Throughout the eighteenth century, the character did not lack
brilliant actors. In the first part of Henry IV., Mills played the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
character, at Drury, in 1716. Booth had previously played it
for one night, in presence of Queen Anne. Bullock filled Lincoln’s
Inn Fields Theatre, with it, in 1721. Quin, in 1738, used
to play the character in the two parts of Henry IV. on successive
nights, and eight years later his Falstaff attracted crowds to “the
Garden.” Barry played it against him at Drury, in 1743 and
1747; but Barry was dull and void of impulse as a school-boy
repeating his task. In 1762, the part, at Drury, fell to Yates, for
whom the piece was brought out, with the character of Hotspur
omitted! To give more prominence to our knight, a scene was
left out. The public did not approve of the plan, for in the same
year Love, celebrated by Churchill for his humor, made his first
appearance at Drury, as Sir John, when Holland, the baker of
Chiswick, played Hotspur, with well-bred warmth. I will add,
that though Quin drew immense houses, yet when Harper, some
years previously, played the same part at Drury, with Booth in
Hotspur, Wilks as the Prince, and Cibber as Glendower, the combined
excellence drew as great houses for a much longer period.
So that Harper’s Falstaff, although inferior to Quin’s, was, as was
remarked, more seen, yet less admired by the town. Shuter
played it almost too “jollily” at the Garden, in 1774. But all
other Falstaffs were extinguished for a time, when Henderson,
although not physically qualified for the part, astonished the town
with his “old boy of the castle,” in 1777 at the Haymarket, and
delighted them two years later, at Covent Garden. At the latter
house, eight years subsequently, Ryder played it respectably, to
Lewis’s Prince of Wales; and in 1791, when the Drury Lane
company were playing at the Haymarket, Palmer represented
Falstaff, and John Kemble mis-represented Hotspur. King tried
the knight at the same “little house,” in 1792, but King, clever as
he was, was physically incapable of representing Falstaff, and he
soon ceased to pretend to do so. The next representative was the
worst the world had yet seen—namely, Fawcett, who first attempted
it at the Garden, in 1795. Blisset appeared in it in
1803, and disappeared also. From this time no new actor tried
the Sir John, in the first part of Henry IV., till 1824, when
Charles Kemble made the Ghost of Shakespeare very uneasy, by
executing a part for which he was totally unfit. He persevered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
however, but the success of Elliston in the part, two years later,
settled the respective merits of two performers, to the advantage
of Robert William, as effectually as Grisi showed the town that
there was but one Norma, by playing it the night after the fatal
attempt made on the Druidess, by Jenny Lind.</p>

<p>The succession of actors who represented Falstaff, in the second
part of Henry IV., was as brilliant as that of the line of representatives
above noticed. Ten years after Betterton and Mills, in
1720, we have Harper, and it is somewhat singular that when
Mills resigned Falstaff to Harper, he took the part of the King.
Hulett, two years subsequently played it at Covent Garden;
and, after another two years, Quin made Drury ecstatic with his
fun. He held the part without a real rival, and fifteen years later,
in 1749, he was as attractive as ever in this portion of the knight’s
character, at Covent Garden. Shuter succeeded him in the part
at this theatre, in 1755; but in 1758, all London, that is the play-goers
of London, might be seen hurrying once more to Drury, to
witness lively Woodward’s <i>very</i> old Falstaff played to Garrick’s
King. The Garden can not be said to have found a superior
means of attraction, when Shuter again represented Sir John, at
the Garden, in 1761, on which occasion the parts of Shallow and
Silence were omitted! The object, however, was to shorten the
piece, and the main attraction was in the coronation pageant, at
the conclusion, in honor of the then young King and Queen, who
were well worthy of the honor thus paid to them.</p>

<p>Love and Holland, who played Falstaff and Hotspur, at Drury
Lane, in 1762, played the Knight and the Prince of Wales, at
the same house, two years subsequently. Nine years after this,
the Garden found a Prince in Mrs. Lessingham, Shuter played
Falstaff to her, but the travesty of the former character was
only in a slight degree less incongruous than that made by Mrs.
Glover, in the present century, who once, if not twice, played the
fat knight, for her own benefit. For the next eight or nine years,
the best Falstaff possessed by London was Henderson. He
played the part first at Drury, and afterward at Covent Garden.
Since Quin, there had been no better representative of Sir John;
and even Palmer, in 1788, could not bring the town from its allegiance
to “admirable Henderson.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>The Falstaffs of the present century, in the second part of this
historical play, have not achieved a greater triumph than Henderson.
Cooke, who played the obese cavalier, in 1804, was not
equal to the part; and Fawcett, in 1821, when the play was revived,
with another coronation pageant in honor of George IV.,
was farther from success than Cooke. The managers at this
period were wiser than those who “got up” the play at the period
of the accession of George III., for they retained Shallow and
Silence, and never were the illustrious two so inimitably represented
as, on this occasion, by Farren and Emery.</p>

<p>The chief Falstaffs of the “Merry Wives of Windsor” are
Betterton (1704), Hulett (1732), Quin (1734), Delane, the young
Irish actor (1743), of whom Garrick was foolish enough to be
jealous; Shuter (1758), Henderson, who first played it at the
Haymarket in 1777, and Lee Lewis in 1784. Bartley, Phelps,
and a clever provincial actor, now in London, named Bartlett,
have also played this character with great effect. The Falstaff
of the last-named actor is particularly good.</p>

<p>I have said that Quin was the greatest of Falstaffs, but the
<i>greatest</i> in the physical acceptation of the term, was undoubtedly
Stephen Kemble. This actor was born almost upon the boards.
His clever, but not very gentle-tempered mother, had just concluded
her performance of Anne Bullen, in a barn, or something
like it, at Kingstown, Herefordshire (1758), when Stephen was
born, about the period when, according to the action of the play,
the Princess Elizabeth is supposed to first see the light. Stephen
when he had grown to manhood, weighed as much as all his
sisters and brothers put together; and on the 7th of October,
1802, he made his appearance at Drury, in the character of Falstaff.
This was nearly twenty years after he had made his <i>début</i>
in London, at Covent Garden, in Othello. Bannister junior
prefaced his performance of the companion of Prince Hal, by
some humorous lines, joking on the heaviness of the actor. As
Pope played Hotspur, I should fancy, if Pope then was anything
like what he was some fifteen or sixteen years later, that Hotspur
was even heavier than Sir John. The lines alluded to were accounted
witty; and I will conclude my record of the principal
actors who have represented the knight, by reproducing them.</p>

<p>In concluding this section of my gossiping record, I will add
that the supposition of Shakespeare having intended to represent
Sir John Oldcastle under the title of Sir John Falstaff, is <i>merely</i> a
supposition. It has never been satisfactorily made out. Far otherwise
is the case with that gallant Welsh man-at-arms, <i>Fluellin</i>. The
original of this character was a David Gam of Brecknock, who
having killed a cousin with an unpronounceable name, in the High
Street of Brecknock, avoided the possibly unpleasant consequences
by joining the Lancastrian party. <i>Gam</i> was merely a nickname,
having reference to an obliquity of vision in the doughty and disputative
David. The real name was Llewellyn; and if Shakespeare
disguised the appellation, it was from notions of delicacy,
probably, as the descendants of the hero were well known and respected
at the English court in Shakespeare’s time. Jones, in his
“History of Brecknockshire,” identifies the personage in question
in this way: “I have called Fluellin a burlesque character, because
his pribbles and prabbles, which were generally out-heroded,
sound ludicrously to an English as well as a Welsh ear; yet, after
all, Llewellyn is a brave soldier and an honest fellow. He is admitted
into a considerable degree of intimacy with the King, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
stands high in his good opinion, which is a strong presumptive
proof, notwithstanding Shakespeare, the better to conceal his object,
describes the death of Sir David Gam, that he intended David
Llewellyn by his portrait of the testy Welshman, for there was
no other person of that country in the English army, who could
have been supposed to be upon such terms of familiarity with the
King.” It is singular that the descendants of the Welsh knight
subsequently dropped the proud old name with more l’s in it than
syllables, and adopted the monosyllabic <i>soubriquet</i>. Squinting
David, who fought so well at Agincourt, would have knocked
down any man who would have dared to address him personally
as “Gam,” that is, “game,” or “cock-eyed.” His posterity proved
less susceptible; and Mr. Jones says of them, in a burst of melancholy
over fallen greatness: “At different periods between the
years 1550 and 1700, I have seen the descendants of the hero of
Agincourt (who lived like a wolf and died like a lion) in the possession
of every acre of ground in the county of Brecon; at the
commencement of the eighteenth century, I find one of them common
bellman of the town of Brecknock, and before the conclusion,
two others, supported by the inhabitants of the parish where they
reside; and even the name of Gam is, in the legitimate line, extinct.”
Mr. Jones might have comforted himself by remembering
that as the Gams went out, the Kembles came in, and that the
illustrious Sarah dignified by her birth the garret of that “Shoulder
of Mutton” public-house, which stood in the street where chivalrous
but squinting Davy had slain his cousin with the unpronounceable
name.</p>

<p>John Kemble occasionally took some unwarrantable liberties
with Shakespeare. When he produced the “Merry Wives of
Windsor” at Covent Garden, in April, 1804 (in which he played
Ford to Cooke’s Falstaff), he deprived Sir Hugh Evans of his
knightly title, out of sheer ignorance, or culpable carelessness.
Blanchard was announced for “Hugh Evans,” without the <i>Sir</i>.
Hawkins, quoting Fuller, says that “anciently in England, there
were more Sirs than Knights;” and as I have noticed in another
page, the monosyllabic Sir was common to both clergymen and
knights. To the first, however, only by courtesy, when they had
attained their degree of B. A. In a “New Trick to cheat the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
Devil,” Anne says to her sire, “Nay, sir;” to which the father replies—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sir me no sirs! I am no knight nor churchman.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>But John Kemble was complimentary to Shakespeare, compared
with poor Frederick Reynolds, who turned the “Merry Wives of
Windsor” into an opera, in 1824; and although Dowton did not
sing Falstaff, as Lablache subsequently did, the two wives, represented
by Miss Stephens and Miss Cubitt, warbled, instead of
being merry in prose, and gave popularity to “I know a bank.”
At the best, Fenton is but an indifferent part, but Braham was
made to render it one marked especially by nonsense. Greenwood
had painted a scene representing Windsor under <i>a glowing summer
sky</i>, under which <i>Fenton</i> (Braham) entered, and remarked, very
like Shakespeare: “How I love this spot where dear Anne Page
has often met me and confessed her love! Ha! I think the <i>sky
is overcast</i>—the wind, too, blows like an approaching storm.
Well, let it blow on! I am prepared to brave its fury.” Whereupon
the orchestra commenced the symphony, and Mr. Braham
took a turn up the stage, according to the then approved plan, before
he commenced his famous air of “Blow, blow, thou <i>winter</i>
wind!” And the fun-anent Falstaff and the Fords was kept waiting
for nonsense like this!</p>

<p>While on the subject of the chivalrous originals of the mock
knights of the Stage, I may be permitted to mention here, that
Jonson’s Bobadil was popularly said to have been named after, if
not founded upon, a knight in the army of the Duke of Alva, engaged
in subduing the Netherlands beneath the despotism of Philip
II. According to Strada, after the victory at Giesen, near Mons,
in 1570, Alva sent Captain Bobadilla to Spain, to inform Philip
of the triumph to his arms. “The ostentation of the message, and
still more of the person who bore it, was the origin of the name
being applied to any vain-glorious boaster.” The Bobadilla family
was an illustrious one, and can hardly be supposed to have furnished
a member who, in any wise, resembles Jonson’s swashbuckler.
On the other hand, there was Boabdil, the last sultan of
Granada, who had indeed borne himself lustily, in his early days,
in the field, but who at last cried like a child at losing that Granada<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
which he was not man enough to defend. But it would be injustice
even to the son of Muley Abel Hassan, to imagine that Jonson
only took his name to distinguish therewith the knight of huge
words and weapons who lodged with Oliver Cob the Water-bearer.</p>

<p>The few other Stage Knights whom I have to name, I will introduce
them to the reader in the next chapter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> Commonwealth had no admiration for the stage, and no
toleration for actors. When theatricals looked up again, the stage
took its revenge, and seldom represented a puritan who was not a
knave. There is an instance of this in the old play, entitled “The
Puritan, or the Widow of Watling Street.” “Wilt steal me thy
master’s chain?” quoth Captain Idle to Nicholas St. Antlings, the
puritan serving-man. “Steal my master’s chain!” quoth Nicholas;
“no, it shall ne’er be said that Nicholas St. Antlings committed
bird-lime. Anything else that I can do,” adds the casuist in a
serge jerkin, “had it been to rob, I would ha’ done it; but I must
not steal, that’s the word, the literal, <i>Thou shalt not steal</i>; and
would you wish me to steal then?” “No, faith,” answers Pyeboard,
the scholar; “that were too much;—but wilt thou nim it
from him?” To which honest St. Nicholas, so anxious to observe
the letter of the law, so careless about its spirit, remarks, with
alacrity, “<i>That</i>, I will!”</p>

<p>I have said in another page, that ridicule was especially showered
down upon some of those whom Oliver delighted to honor.
As late as the era of Sir George Etherege, we find “one of Oliver’s
knights” figuring as the buffoon of that delicate gentleman’s comedy,
“The Comical Revenge.” It is hardly creditable to the times,
or to the prevailing taste, that the theatre in Lincoln’s-inn Fields
cleared one thousand pounds, in less than a month, by this comedy;
and that the company gained more reputation by it, than by any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
preceding piece represented on the same stage. The plot is soon
told. Two very fine and not very profligate gentlemen, Lord
Beaufort and Colonel Bruce, are in love with a tolerably-refined
lady, Graciana. The lord wins the lady, and the philosophical
soldier accepts a certain Aurelia, who has the singular merit of
being in love with the Colonel. The under-plot has “Oliver’s
knight” for its hero. The latter is a Sir Nicholas Cully who is
cheated out of a promissory note for one thousand pounds, by two
gentlemen-sharpers, Wheadle and Palmer. Sir Nicholas is partly
saved by the gay, rather than moral, Sir Frederick Frolick. The
latter recovers the note, but he passes off his mistress on Sir Nicholas
as his sister, and induces him to marry her. The only difference
between the sharpers and the “Knight baronet,” Sir Frederick,
is this:—Wheadle had dressed up <i>his</i> mistress, Grace, as
Widow Rich; and Sir Nicholas had engaged to marry her,
under certain penalties, forced on him by Wheadle and his friend.
Sir Frederick, at the conclusion, marries the Widow, to oblige a
lady who is fond of him, and the curtain falls upon the customary
indecent jokes, and the following uneasy and metrical maxim:—</p>

<p>What the two Bettertons made of Lord Beaufort and Graciana,
I do not pretend to say, but Nokes is said to have been “screamingly
farcical,” to adopt an equivalent modern phrase, in Sir Nicholas
Cully. His successor, Norris, fell short of the great original
in broad humor, but Nokes himself was surpassed by Dogget, who
played “Oliver’s Knight” with all the comic effect which he imparted
to the then low comedy part of Shylock. It is inexplicable
to me how any actor would ever have extracted a laugh from the
audience at anything he had to say, or chose to do, when enacting
the “Cavalier of the Commonwealth.” There is not a humorous
speech, nor a witty remark, nor a comic situation for the knight to
profit by. In 1664, however, people could laugh heartily at seeing
one of the Protector’s knights swindled, and beaten on the
stage. The knight is represented as a thirsty drunkard, “all the
drier for the last night’s wetting,” with a more eager desire to attack
the ladies of cavaliers than cavaliers themselves, and no reluctance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
to cheat any man who will undertake to throw a main
with him at dice. He has, however, great reluctance to pay his
losses, when he unconsciously falls into the hands of a greater
knave than himself, and bodily declares—</p>

<p>He had less boldness in accepting the results of such a declaration,
and in meeting his antagonist at the end of a rapier. He is
brought to the sticking-point, just as Acres is, by an assurance that
his adversary is an arrant coward. The scene of “the Field” is
worth quoting in part, inasmuch as it is not only an illustration of
the spirit of chivalry, as imputed to Oliver’s knights by cavalier-poets,
but also as it will, perhaps, serve to show that when Sheridan
sat down at his table in Orchard Street, Portman Square, to
bring Acres and Beverley together in mortal combat, he probably
had a copy of Etherege’s play before—or the memory of it strong
within—him.</p>

<p>Wheadle and Cully are on the stage:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>W.</i> What makes you so serious?</p>

<p><i>C.</i> I am sorry I did not provide for both our safeties.</p>

<p><i>W.</i> How so?</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Colonel Hanson is my neighbor, and very good friend. I might have
acquainted him with the business, and got him, with a file of musketeers, to
secure us all.</p>

<p><i>W.</i> But this would not secure your honor. What would the world have
judged.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Let the world have judged what it would! Have we not had many
precedents of late? and the world knows not what to judge.</p>
</div>

<p>It may be observed here, that Sir Nicholas may be supposed to
be alluding to such men as Hans Behr, who was much addicted to
firing printed broadsides at his adversaries, who advertised him as
“<i>poltroon</i>” in return. There are some placards having reference
to this matter, in the British Museum, which admirably display
the caution of the wordsmen and the spirit of the swordsmen of
that day. But to resume. Cully, observing that his adversary
has not arrived, suggests that his own duty has been fulfilled, and
that he “will be going,” the more particularly, says the knight, as
“the air is so bleak, I can no longer endure it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>W.</i> Have a little patience. Methinks I see two making toward us in the
next close.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Where? Where? ’Tis them!</p>

<p><i>W.</i> Bear up bravely, now, like a man.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> I protest I am the worst dissembler, now, in cases of this nature.</p>

<p><i>W.</i> <i>Allons!</i> Look like a man of resolution. Whither, whither go you?</p>

<p><i>C.</i> But to the next house to make my will, for fear of the worst. Tell
them I’ll be here again, presently.</p>
</div>

<p>The provident knight is, however, detained, and on Palmer and
that gentleman’s second appearing, the swords are measured, “and
all strip but Cully, who fumbles with his doublet.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>P.</i> Come, sir! are you ready for this sport?</p>

<p><i>C.</i> By-and-by, sir. I will not rend the buttons from my doublet for no
man’s pleasure.</p>
</div>

<p>And so “Oliver’s Knight” continues to procrastinate; he can
not be either pricked or pinked into action; and at length, pleading
that his conscience will not let him fight in a wrong cause, he
purchases a whole skin, at the price of a promissory note for a
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>I have said that there is no comic situation for the actor who
represents Sir Nicholas, but the scene from which the above passages
are taken may, perhaps, be an exception to the rule. That
Sheridan has profited by it, will be clear to any reader who will
take the trouble to compare this scene with the fighting scene in
the “Rivals.” The latter is far richer in humor, and while we
care very little what becomes of Sir Nicholas, we should regret
that any harm should befall poor Acres—although he prefers
fighting at forty paces, would stand sidewise to be shot at, feels
that he would be horribly afraid if he were alone, and confesses that
valor oozes out at the palms of his hands when his adversary appears
in sight, with pistols for two.</p>

<p>Sir Nicholas is in spirits again when making love to one whom
he considers a woman of rank and fortune. No cavalier could
then vie with him in finery. “I protest,” he says, “I was at least
at sixteen brokers, before I could put myself exactly in the fashion.”
But with all this, he is a craven again when he is called
upon to enter and address her who awaits the wooing with impatience.
“Come!” he exclaims, “I will go to the tavern and swallow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
two whole quarts of wine instantly; and when I am drunk,
ride on a drawer’s back, to visit her.” Wheadle suggests that
“some less frolic will do, to begin with.”—“I will cut three drawers
over the pate, then,” says the knight, “and go with a tavern-lanthorn
before me at noonday;”—just as very mad gallants were
wont to do.</p>

<p>The liquor has not the effect of rendering Oliver’s knight decent,
for in proposing the health of “my lord’s sister,” he does it in the
elegant form of “Here’s a brimmer to her then, and all the fleas
about her;” offers to break the windows to show his spirit, and in
the lady’s very presence exclaims, “Hither am I come to be drunk,
that you may see me drunk, and here’s a health to your flannel
petticoat.” The latter <i>gentillesse</i> is by way of proof of the knight’s
quality, for it was of the very essence of polite manners, when a
spirited gentleman drank to a spirited lady, to strain the wine
through what the Chesterfields and Mrs. Chapones of that day, if
such were to be found, would not have blushed to call “their
smocks.”</p>

<p>But enough of the way in which the stage represented “one of
Oliver’s knights.” He is not worse than the courtiers and gentlemen
by whom he is swindled out of his money and into a wife.
Nay, nearly the last sentence put into his mouth is, at least, a complimentary
testimony to the side of which Sir Nicholas is but an
unworthy member. “If I discover this,” he remarks, “I am lost.
I shall be ridiculous even to our own party.”—The reader will,
probably, not require to be reminded that before Etherege drew
Cully, Jonson had depicted Sogliardo, and that the latter, in the
very spirit of Oliver’s knight, remarks:—“I do not like the humor
of challenge; it may be accepted.”</p>

<p>The stage, from about the middle of the seventeenth century to
nearly the middle of the succeeding century, was uncommonly
busy with knights as heroes of new plays. The piece which
brought most money to the theatrical treasury, after the “Comical
Revenge,” was the “Sir Martin Mar-all,” an adaptation by Dryden,
from the “Etourdi” of Molière. Such adaptations were in
fashion, and the heroes of the French author were invariably
knighted on their promotion to the English stage. Such was the
case with “Sir Solomon, or the Cautious Coxcomb,” adapted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
Carill, from Molière’s “Ecole des Femmes.” The same course
was adopted by Mrs. Behn when she transferred Molière’s “Malade
Imaginaire” to the stage at Dorset Gardens, and transformed
<i>Argon</i> into <i>Sir Patient Fancy</i>. One of the characters in this intolerably
indecent play instructs the city knight’s lady how to divide
her time according to the fashion set by “the quality.”
“From eight to twelve,” he says, “you ought to employ in dressing.
Till two, at dinner. Till five, in visits. Till seven, at the
play. Till nine, in the park; and at ten, to supper with your
lover.”</p>

<p>In the “Sir Barnaby Whig, or No Wit like a Woman’s,” one
of D’Urfey’s comedies, and produced in 1681, we have again a
hero who is described as one of Oliver’s knights. The play is
avowedly a party piece, and the author, in his prologue, remarks,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“That he shall know both parties now, he glories;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By hisses, Whigs; and by their claps, the Tories.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The audience at the “Theatre Royal,” in the days of Charles II.,
was made especially merry by this poor jest. Sir Barnaby is represented
as a Cromwellian fanatic, who will not drink the King’s
health; is in an agony of terror at hearing that an army of twenty
thousand men is about to sweep every rebel from the land; turns
traitor; sings a comic song against the Roundheads; is saluted as
Rabbi Achitophel; offers to turn Roman Catholic or Mohammedan;
and is finally consigned to Newgate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Behn, in the same year, had <i>her</i> political knight as well as
D’Urfey. In this lady’s more than usually licentious play, the
“City Heiress,” performed at Dorset Gardens, she has a Sir Timothy
Treat-all for her comic hero. She boasts in her introduction
that her play is political, loyal, true Tory all over; and as “Whiggism
has become a jest,” she makes a caricature of Sir Timothy,
an old, seditious, Oliverian knight, who keeps open house for commonwealth-men
and true-blue Protestants. He is contrasted with
two Tory knights, Sir Anthony and Sir Charles Meriwill, and a
Tory gentleman, named Wilding. The old Whig knight, however,
is by far the least disreputable fellow of the lot. The Tory knights
and their friends are rogues, perjurers, and something worse.
When they are not on the stage, Mrs. Behn is not afraid to tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
what they are about, and <i>that</i> in the very plainest language.
“D—n the City!” exclaims the courtly Sir Charles. “Ay, ay!”
adds his uncle, Sir Anthony, “and <i>all</i> the Whigs, Charles, d—n
all the Whigs!”—And in such wise did Mrs. Afra Behn take
vengeance upon political enemies, to the infinite delight of loyal
audiences. How the Whig knights ever kept their own against
the assaults made on them in plays, prologues, and epilogues, is, as
Mr. Slick says, “a caution!” It is a fact, however, that these political
plays were far more highly relished than those which merely
satirized passing social follies. Audiences roared at the dull jokes
against the Oliverian knights, but they had no relish for the rhyme-loving
Sir Hercules Buffoon, of Lacy.</p>

<p>For one stage knight we may be said to be indebted to
Charles II. himself. It was from a hint from him that Crowne
wrote his “Sir Courtly Nice,” produced at the Theatre Royal
shortly after the death of Charles. Sir Courtly alludes to the
death of one, and the accession of a new, king, in very flattering
terms:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What nation upon earth, besides our own,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But by a loss like ours had been undone?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ten ages scarce such royal worth display</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As England lost and found in one strange day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Of all the comedies with knights for their heroes, this one of Sir
Courtly Nice retained a place longest on the stage. The hero was
originally played by handsome, but hapless Will Mountfort. Cibber
played it at the Haymarket in Queen Anne’s time, 1706, and
again at Drury Lane, and before George I. at Hampton Court.
Foote and Cibber, jun., and Woodward, were there presentatives
of the gallant knight, and under George II. Foote played it, for
the first time, at Drury Lane, and the younger Cibber at Covent
Garden, in 1746, and Woodward, at the latter house, in 1751.
The last-named actor was long the favorite representative of the
gentlemanly knight, retaining the character as his own for full
a quarter of a century, and being succeeded, but not surpassed in
it, by sparkling Lewis, at Covent Garden, in 1781.</p>

<p>The satire in this piece against the Puritans is of a more refined
character than in any other play of the period; and the contrast
between the rash and ardent cavalier and the cautious Puritan is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
very fairly drawn. “Suppose I see not many vices,” says the
Roundhead, Testimony, “morality is not the thing. The heathens
had morality; and, forsooth, would you have your footman or your
coachman to be no better than Seneca?” This is really complimentary
to the Cromwellians; and there is but a good-natured
dash of satire in the answer of Testimony, when asked what time
of day it may be, that—“Truly, I do believe it is about four. I
can not say it positively, for I would not tell a lie for the whole
world.”</p>

<p>I find little worthy of notice in other dramatic pieces having
knights for their heroes. Southeran produced one entitled, “Sir
Anthony Love” at the Theatre Royal in 1691, for the purpose of
showing off Mrs. Mountfort as an errant lady in male attire.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century, the knights gave name to a few historical
pieces not worth recording. The only exceptions are
scarcely worthy of more notice. Dodsley’s “Sir John Cockle at
Court” made our ancestors, of George the Second’s time, laugh at
the sequel of the “King and the Miller of Mansfield;” and “Sir
Roger de Coverley” was made the hero of a pantomime at Covent
Garden in 1746. By this time, however, the fashion was extinct
of satirizing living politicians under knightly names. To detail
the few exceptions to the rule would only fatigue the perhaps already
wearied reader.</p>

<p>To what a low condition knight and squire could fall may be
seen in the Sir Joseph Wittol and Captain Bluffe, in Congreve’s
comedy, the “Old Batchelor.” The only redeeming point about
this disreputable pair is, that, cowards and bullies as they are,
they have both read a little. The Captain has dipped into history,
and he remarks that “Hannibal was a pretty fellow in his day, it
must be granted; but, alas, sir! were he alive now, he would be
nothing; nothing on the earth.” Sir Joseph, the knight, <i>in comitatu
Bucks</i>, has also indulged in a little reading, but that of a lighter
sort than the Captain’s. When the gallant Captain affects not
to be frightened at the aspect of Sharper, and exclaims, “I am
prepared for him now, and he shall find he might have safer
roused a sleeping lion,” the knight remarks, “Egad, if he should
hear the lion roar, he’d cudgel him into an ass, and his primitive
braying. Don’t you remember the story in Æsop’s Fables, Bully?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
Egad, there are good morals to be picked out of Æsop’s Fables,
let me tell you that; and ‘Reynard the Fox’ too;” to which the
deboshed Captain can only reply, “D—n your morals!” as though
he despised fiction when compared with history.</p>

<p>Some of the stage knights are wonderfully great boasters, yet
exceedingly dull fellows. I do not know that in the mouth of any
one of them there is put so spirited a remark as the great Huniades
made to Ulderick, Count of Sicily. The latter asked for a conference
with the great governor of Hungary. Huniades bade him
come to the Hungarian camp. The offended Ulderick, in a great
chafe, replied that it was beneath him to do such a thing, seeing
that he was descended from a long line of princely ancestors;
whereas Huniades was the first of his family who had ever been
raised to honor. The Hungarian very handsomely remarked, “I
do not compare myself with your ancestors; but <i>with you</i>!” This
has always appeared to me as highly dramatic in spirit. There
is nothing half so spirited in the knightly pieces brought on the
stage during the reign of George III., and which caused infinite
delight to very easily-pleased audiences. It is well known that
the good-natured Sovereign of England, although unassuming in
his domestic character, was exceedingly fond of display in public
ceremonies. He used to arrange the paraphernalia of an installation
of the Garter with all the energy and care of an anxious stage-manager.
The people generally were as anxious to have an idea
of the reality. On one occasion, in the preceding reign, they so
nearly forced their way into the banqueting-room, where the
knights were holding festival, that the troops fired over their heads
in order to frighten them into dispersing. Under George III.
they were more content to view these splendors through a dramatic
lens.</p>

<p>In 1771, accordingly, the splendors of the then late installation
of the Garter were reproduced on the stage, in a masque, called
“The Institution of the Garter, or Arthur’s Round Table Restored.”
The show was as good as the piece was bad. The former
was got up to profit the managers, the latter to flatter or do
homage to the King and Queen. It was at once cumbersome and
comic. A trio of spirits opened the delectable entertainment by
summoning other spirits from every nook and corner of the skies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
the moon’s horns included, to the work of escorting the car of the
Male Genius of England, the husband probably of Britannia, down
to earth. Nothing can exceed the alacrity with which the spirits
and bards of the empyreal heaven obey the summons. They descend
with the car of the Genius, singing a heavy chorus, ponderous
as the chariot they help to “waft down,”—in which, not the
chariot, but the chorus, there is the assurance that</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The bliss that spotless patriots feel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is kindred to the bliss above,”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>so that we may hope, though we can not feel certain, that there are
some few persons here below, who are not unconscious of an ante-past
of heaven.</p>

<p>The Genius is a civil and polished personage, who with due remembrance
to metropolitan fogs, very courteously apologizes to
the spirits, that he has been the cause of bringing them down</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To this grosser atmosphere awhile.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>After such celestial compliments as these, he despatches them to
shed heavenly influences over Windsor, while he remains to hold
a little colloquy with the Druids, “Britain’s old philosophers,” as he
calls them. He adds an assertion that may, probably, have startled
the Society of Antiquaries of that day, namely, that the aforesaid
Druids—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Still enamored of their ancient haunts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unseen of mortal eyes, do hover round</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their ruined altars and their sacred oaks,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>which may account for that loose heterodoxy which marked the period
when Druids exercised these unseen influences.</p>

<p>The Genius requests the Druids to have the kindness to repair
to Windsor, where the order is in the act of being founded by Edward,
and there direct his choice in the selection of members.
This is a very heathenish idea, but Druids and Bards are alike
delighted at it; for, as the Genius remarks, Edward’s perspicuity,
his intellectual eyes, needed charming</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">“from the mists</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It haply hath contracted from a long</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unebbing current of prosperity.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The heathen priests are flaming patriots, and express their eagerness
to leave Heaven for England, seeing that the new order may
be the means to propagate</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The sovereignty of England, and erect</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her monarchs into judges of mankind.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As this expressed end has not been accomplished, and the order
has not propagated the sovereignty of England, we may logically
conclude that the Druids themselves hardly knew much of the
subject upon which they were singing to their tuneless harps.
Meanwhile, the first Bard, in a bass song, petitions the south
gales to blow very mildly, and bring blue skies and sweet
smells to the installation.</p>

<p>The ceremony of the installation then opens to the view when
all the knights have been created, except the King’s son, Edward
the Black Prince, who really was not created knight when the
order was founded. How far the Druids have succeeded in influencing
the choice of the King, there is no possibility of knowing.
No one utters a word, save royal father and son: and the
commonplace prose which they deliver does not give us a very
exalted idea of the Druidic inspiration. The old sages themselves,
however, are perfectly satisfied with the result; and in a
noisy chorus, they make an assertion which might well have
frightened the Archbishop of Canterbury—had he cared about
the matter. After vaticinating that the name of the Prince
should roll down through the tide of ages, they add, that glory
shall fire him, and virtue inspire him,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent13">“Till blessed and blessing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent13">Power possessing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From earth to heaven he lifts his soul,”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>a feat which one would like to see put upon canvass by a Pre-Raphaelite.</p>

<p>While the Knights are supposed to be preparing to pass to the
hall, the scene takes us to the front of the castle, where crowds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
of liege and loyal people are assembled. First Citizen, “very
like a whale indeed,” sings a comic song, which, as a specimen
of the homage offered to monarch and consort, more than fourscore
years ago, is worth transcribing—for both its imagery and
syntax:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">“Oh, the glorious installation!</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Happy nation!</div>

    <div class="verse indent8">Such a scene!</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Valor he, sir;</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Virtue she, sir;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which our hearts will ever win.</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Sweet her face is,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">With such graces</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Show what goodness dwells within.</div>

    <div class="verse indent8">Feathers wagging,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Trailing, sailing, on the ground;</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Loud in talking,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Proud in walking,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nodding, ogling, smirking round.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The banquet over, and more comic business, as dreary as the
song above quoted, being concluded, King Edward walks forth
into the garden for refreshment—and there the Genius of England
takes him by the hand. Edward, we are sorry to say, knows
so little of this Genius, that he boldly asks him, “What art thou,
stranger?” We should, only with reluctance, trouble our readers
with all this unrecognised Genius says in reply to the royal inquirer,
but one passage may be transcribed to show what the
popular spirit was thought to be in the last century.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Know that those actions which are great and good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Receive a nobler sanction from the free</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And universal voices from all mankind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which is the voice of Heaven, than from the highest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The most illustrious act of royal power.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>This maxim of the Genius of England further shows that the
individual in question not only passed off prose for blank verse,
but stole the phrase of “Vox populi vox Dei,” and tried to render
it unrecognisable by indefinite extension.</p>

<p>That the sentiment is not very much to the taste of the Monarch
may be conjectured from the fact that he sulkily lets it pass
without any comment, and very naturally falls asleep of being
talked-at by so heavily-pinioned a Genius. The latter avails
himself of the opportunity to exhibit to the slumbering Monarch
a vision of the future of England, down to the era of George
and Charlotte. The spectacle soothes him still less than the
speech, though oppressive ecstacy may be sweet, and Edward
springs into wakefulness, and loudly exclaiming that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“This is too much for human strength to bear,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>the loquacious Genius flies at him again with some remarkable
figures of speech, to which the worn-out Edward answers nothing.
The Genius, unwilling to attribute his taciturnity to rudeness, finds
a satisfactory solution in the conclusion that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Astonishment seals up his lips.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The founder of the “Garter” will not provoke the eloquence
of the heavenly visiter by unsealing the lips which astonishment
is supposed to have sealed up, and the remainder of the piece is
left to Genius and chorus, who unite in a musical asseveration, to
the effect that the reigning Sovereign of England is</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The great miracle on earth, a patriot king,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and so terminates, amid the most vociferous plaudits, the scenic
story of the Garter, enacted in celebration of the great installation
of 1771.</p>

<p>The real installation was, by far, a more cheerful matter than
its theatrical counterfeit. It took place on the 25th of July. At
this ceremony the King raised to the dignity of Knights of the
illustrious order, his sons the Prince of Wales and the Bishop of
Osnaburg, his brother the Duke of Cumberland, with the Queen’s
brother, the Duke of Mecklenburgh, and Prince Henry of Brunswick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
the Dukes of Marlborough and Grafton, and the Earls of
Gower and Albermarle. The festival occupied the entire day.
Four mortal hours in the morning were consumed in making the
Knights, after which Sovereign and chapter dined together in St.
George’s Hall. While the banquet was progressing, Queen
Charlotte sat in a gallery, looking on. She was brilliantly surrounded,
and had at her right side the pretty Princess Royal, and
the infant Prince Ernest at her left. One of her Majesty’s
brothers stood by each royal child. On the right of the canopy
under which the King dined, was a long table, at which were
seated all the Knights, in full view of the occupants of raised
seats and a gallery in front. At the end of the first course, the
good-natured Monarch was determined to make a Knight Bachelor
of some deserving individual present, and he rendered good
Mr. Dessac (clerk of the check, belonging to the band of Gentlemen
Pensioners) supremely happy by selecting <i>him</i>. As soon as
the other courses had been served, and the banquet was concluded,
which was not till between six and seven o’clock, the whole
of the cavaliers and company separated in haste, hurrying to
their respective rooms or hotels, to dress for the ball which was
to be held in the Great Guard-Room. When all the guests were
there assembled, the King and Queen entered the apartment about
nine o’clock. Whereupon the Duke of Gloucester danced a couple
of minuets with a brace of duchesses—Grafton and Marlborough.
The minuets were continued till eleven o’clock. No one seemed
to tire of the stately, graceful dance, and it was only during
the hour that followed, that any young lady, as anxious as the
elegant American belle, who told Mr. Oliphant at Minnesota
that “she longed to shake the knots out of her legs,” had a chance
of indulging in her liveliness. During one hour—from eleven
to midnight—country dances were accomplished. I say accomplished,
for only three were danced—and each set procured
twenty minutes of very active exercise. Midnight had scarcely
been tolled out by the castle clock when the festive throng separated—and
thus closed one of the most brilliant installations that
Windsor had ever seen, since Edward first became the founder of
the order. If there was any drawback to the gratification which
the King felt on this occasion, it was at beholding Wilkes and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
daughter conspicuously seated among the spectators in the courtyard;
whither the man whom the King hated had penetrated by
means of a ticket from Lord Tankerville. It was at this period that
Mr. Fox revived, for a few court-days, the fashion of appearing
at the drawing-room in red-heeled shoes. To the public, these
matters were far more comic than the comic portion of the “Installation,”
in which (setting aside the Edward III. of Aikin, and
the Genius of England, played by Reddish) King enacted Sir
Dingle, a court fool knighted; Parsons, Nat Needle; and Weston,
Roger. Never was foolish knight played by an actor so chivalrous
of aspect as King.</p>

<p>I will avail myself of this opportunity to state that at solemn
ceremonies, like that above named, four of our kings of England
were knighted by their own subjects. These were Edward III.,
Henry VI. and VII., and Edward VI. The latter was dubbed
by the Lord Protector, who was himself empowered to perform
the act by letters patent, under the great seal. At a very early
period, priests, or prelates rather, sometimes conferred the honor
on great public occasions. The Westminster Synod deprived them
of this privilege in 1102.</p>

<p>It has been said that English knights wearing foreign orders,
without permission of their own sovereign, are no more knights
in reality than those stage knights of whom I have been treating.
This, however, is questionable, if so great an authority as Coke
be not in error. That great lawyer declares that a knight, by
whomsoever created, can sue and be sued by his knightly title,
and that such is not the case with persons holding other foreign
titles, similar to those of the English peerage. Let me add that,
among other old customs, it was once common in our armies for
knighthood to be conferred previous to a battle, to arouse courage,
rather than afterward, as is the case now—after the action, in
order to reward valor. Even this fashion is more reasonable than
that of the Czar, who claps stars and crosses of chivalry on the
bosoms of beaten generals, to make them pass in Muscovy for
conquerors.</p>

<p>In connection with the stage, knights have figured sometimes
before, as well as behind the curtain. Of all the contests ever
maintained, there was never, in its way a fiercer than that which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
took place between Sir William Rawlings, and young Tom Dibdin.
The son of “tuneful Charlie,” born in 1771, and held at the font,
as the “Lady’s Magazine” used to say, by Garrick, was not above
four years of age when he played Cupid to Mrs. Siddons’ Venus,
in Shakespeare’s Jubilee. It was hardly to be expected that after
this and a course of attendance as choir-boy at St. Paul’s, he would
settle down quietly to learn upholstery. This <i>was</i> expected of
him by his very unreasonable relatives, who bound him apprentice
to the city knight, Sir William Rawlings, a then fashionable
upholsterer in Moorfields. The boy was dull as the mahogany he
had to polish, and the knight could never make him half so bright
in business matters. “Tom Dibdin,” thus used to remark the city
cavalier—“Tom Dibdin is the stupidest hound on earth!” The
knight, however, changed his mind when his apprentice, grown up
to man’s estate, produced “The Cabinet.” Sir William probably
thought that the opera was the upholstery business set to music.
But before this point was reached, dire was the struggle between
the knight and the page, who would not “turn over a new leaf.”
When work was over, the boy was accustomed to follow it up with
a turn at the play—generally in the gallery of the Royalty
Theatre. On one of these occasions the knight followed him
thither, dragged him out, gave him a sound thrashing, and, next
morning, brought him before that awfully squinting official, John
Wilkes. The struggle ended in a drawn battle, and Tom abandoned
trade: and instead of turning out patent bedsteads, turned
out the “English Fleet,” and became the father of “Mother
Goose.” He would have shown less of his relationship to the
family of that name, had he stuck to his tools; in the latter case
he might have taken his seat as Lord Mayor, in a chair made by
himself, and in those stirring times he might have become as good
a knight as his master.</p>

<p>As it was, the refuse of knighthood had a hard time of it. He
was actor of all work, wrote thousands of songs, which he sold as
cheap as chips, and composed four pieces for Astley’s Theatre, for
which he received fourteen pounds—hardly the price of a couple
of arm-chairs. How he flourished and fell after this, may be seen
in his biography. He had fortune within his grasp at one time,
but he lost his hold when he became proprietor of a theatre. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
ex-apprentice of the old knight-upholder could not furnish his
own house with audiences, and the angry knight himself might
have been appeased could his spirit have seen the condition into
which “poor Tom” had fallen just previous to his death, some
twenty years ago.</p>

<p>But I fear I have said more than enough about stage knights;
may I add some short gossip touching real knights with stage
ladies? Before doing so, I may just notice that the wedded wife
of a <i>bona fide</i> knight once acted on the English boards under the
chivalric name—and a time-honored one it is in Yorkshire—of
her husband, Slingsby. Dame, or Lady Slingsby, who had been
formerly a Mrs. Lee, was a favorite actress in the days of James
II. She belonged to the Theatre Royal, resided in St. James’s
parish, and was buried in Pancras church-yard in March 1693-4.
In the list of the Slingsbys, baronets, of Scriven, given in Harborough’s
“History of Knaresborough,” Sir Henry Slingsby, who
died in 1692, is the only one of whose marriage no notice is taken.
But to our stage ladies and gallant lovers.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">After</span> the loose fashion of Master Crowne’s Married Beau, it
was no uncommon thing for gallants once to woo the mimic ladies
of the scene.</p>

<p>From the time that ladies first appeared upon the stage, they
seem to have exercised a powerful attraction upon the cavaliers.
Under date of the 18th October, 1666, Evelyn says in his Diary:
“This night was acted my Lord Broghill’s tragedy, ‘Mustapha,’
before their majesties at court, at which I was present, very seldom
going to the public theatres, for many reasons, now, as they are
abused to an atheistical liberty, foul and undecent women now
(and never till now) permitted to appear and act, who, inflaming
several young noblemen and gallants, became their misses, and to
some their wives; witness the Earl of Oxford, Sir R. Howard,
Prince Rupert, the Earl of Dorset, and another greater person
than any of them, who fell into their snares, to the reproach of
their noble families, and ruin of both body and soul. I was invited
by my Lord Chamberlain to see this tragedy, exceedingly
well written, though in my mind I did not approve of any such
pastime in a time of such judgments and calamities.”</p>

<p>A year and a half earlier than the date of the above entry,
namely, April 3, 1665, Pepys notices the same play, with some
allusions to the ladies: “To a play at the Duke’s of my Lord
Orrery’s, called ‘Mustapha,’ which being not good, made Betterton’s
part and Ianthe’s but ordinary too. All the pleasure of the
play was, the king and my Lady Castlemaine were there; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
pretty witty Nell of the King’s House, and the younger Marshall
sat next us, which pleased me mightily.” The play, however, is
not so poor a one as Pepys describes it, and the cast was excellent.
Betterton played Solyman the Magnificent. Mustapha and
Zanga, the sons of Solyman, were played by Harris and Smith;
and Young made a capital Cardinal. Mrs. Betterton was the
Roxalana; and Mrs. Davies, one of those ladies who, like her
sisters, the two Marshalls, Hughes and Nelly, exercised the fatal
attraction over young noblemen and gallants, deplored by Evelyn,
was the magnificent Queen of Hungary. Mustapha continued to
be the favorite play until the theatre closed, when the plague began
to spread. Pepys’s “Ianthe” was Mrs. Betterton, of whom he
says, on the 22d October, 1662, “the players do tell me that Betterton
is not married to Ianthe, as they say; but also that he is a
very sober, serious man, studious and humble, following of his
studies, and is rich already with what he gets and saves.” Betterton,
however, married the lady, Miss Saunderson, in 1663.
She had been famous for her Ianthe in Davenant’s “Siege of
Rhodes;” and she played Shakespeare’s heroines with great effect.
Pepys rightly designates the author of the play, Lord Orrery.
Lord Broghill was made Earl of Orrery, five years before Evelyn
saw his play. I may add that Mustapha has appeared in half-a-dozen
different versions on the stage. Probably the worst of these
was Mallet’s; the latter author created great amusement by one
of his passages, in which he said:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">“<i>Future</i> sultans</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Have</i> shunned the marriage tie;”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>a confusion of tenses which has been compared with a similar
error in the sermons of so correct a writer as Blair (vol. v., third
edition, page 224), “in <i>future</i> periods the light <i>dawned</i> more and
more.”</p>

<p>Although Evelyn, in 1666, says that “never till now” were
women admitted to assume characters on the stage, he is not quite
correct in his assertion. There were actresses full thirty years
previous to that period. Thus, in 1632, the “Court Beggar” was
acted at the Cockpit. In the last act, Lady Strangelove says:—“If
you have a short speech or two, the boy’s a pretty actor, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
his mother can play her part: women-actors now grow in request.”
Our ancestors wisely followed a foreign fashion when they ceased
to employ boys in female characters. Prynne says, in 1633,
“They have now their female players in Italy and other foreign
parts;” and in Michaelmas 1629, they had French women-actors
in a play personated at Blackfriars, to which there was a great
resort. Geneste quotes Freshwater as writing thus of French
actresses in Paris, in 1629: “Yet the women are the best actors;
they play their own parts, a thing much desired in England.”</p>

<p>In Davenant’s patent for opening Lincoln’s-inn Fields, in 1661,
permission was given for the engaging of women as actresses, on
the ground that the employment of men in such parts had given
great offence. I more particularly notice this matter, because it
was a knight who first opened a theatre with a regular female
<i>troupe</i> added to the usual number of male actors. Sir William’s
ladies were Mrs. Davenport, Mrs. Saunderson, Mrs. Davies, Mrs.
Long, Mrs. Gibbs, Mrs. Norris, Mrs. Holden, and Mrs. Jennings.
The first four were Sir William’s principal actresses, and these
were boarded in the knight’s own dwelling-house. Their title of
“Mistress” does not necessarily imply that they were married
ladies, but rather that they were old enough to be so.</p>

<p>This knight, too, was the first who introduced scenery on the
stage. I will add (<i>par parenthèse</i>) that it was a priest who first
suggested the levelling of the pit with the stage, for the purpose
of masquerades and balls.</p>

<p>Prynne was not among those who fancied that morality would
profit by the introduction of actresses. He had his misgivings as
to the effects likely to be produced on the susceptible young gallants
of his day. Touching the appearance of the French actresses
at the Blackfriars Theatre, noticed above, he calls it “an
impudent, shameful, un-womanish, graceless, if not more than
w——ish attempt.” The fashion was, undoubtedly, first set by
the court, and by no less a person than a queen. Anne of Denmark,
wife of James I., acted a part in a pastoral. They who
remember some of the incidents of the training she gave her son,
the princely knight young Henry, will hardly think that Anne
gave dignity to the occupation she temporarily assumed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Saunderson is said to have been the first regularly-engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
actress who opened her lips on the English stage. Had she and
her compeers only half the charms which report ascribed to them,
they must have afforded far more pleasure to audience and spectators
than the “beautiful woman-actor,” Stephen Hamerton Hart,
with his womanly dignity; Burt, with his odious female sprightliness;
or Goffe, who was as hearty and bustling as old Mrs. Davenport.
King Charles himself and his cavaliers, too, must have
been especially delighted when they were no longer kept waiting
for the commencement of a play, on the ground that the <i>Queen</i>
was not yet shaved.</p>

<p>It is curious that there were some people not near so strait-laced
as Prynne, who considered that public virtue would suffer shipwreck
if actresses were permitted to establish themselves in the
general favor. The opposite party, of course, went to an opposite
extreme; and in 1672, not only were “Philaster,” and Killigrew’s
“Parson’s Wedding,” played <i>entirely</i> by women, but one of the
“Miss” Marshalls, gay daughter of a Presbyterian minister, on
both occasions spoke the prologue and epilogue in male attire.
“Philaster” is simply an absurd piece, which was rendered popular
by Hart and Nell Gwyn; but with respect to Killigrew’s
piece, it is so disgusting, from the commencement to the finale,
that I can hardly fancy how any individuals, barely alive to their
humanity, could be brought to utter and enact the turpitudes which
Killigrew set down for them, or that an audience could be kept
from fleeing from the house before the first act was over.</p>

<p>But the gallants could endure anything rather than a return to
such effects as are alluded to by a contemporary writer, who, by
way of introducing a female Desdemona, said in his prologue—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Our women are defective and so sized</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You’d think they were some of the guard disguised;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, to speak truth, men act that are between</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forty and fifty, wenches of fifteen;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With brow so large, and nerve so uncompliant,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When you call <i>Desdemona</i>—enter <i>Giant</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Half a century elapsed before knight or gentleman took an actress
from the stage, for the purpose of making her his wife. The
squires, in this case, had precedence of the knights; and the antiquary,
Martin Folkyes, led the way by espousing Lucretia Bradshaw,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
the uncorrupted amid corruption, and the original Corinna
in the “Confederacy,” Dorinda in the “Beaux Stratagem,” and
Arabella Zeal in the “Fair Quaker of Deal.” This marriage
took place in 1713, and there was not a happier hearth in England
than that of the antiquary and the actress. A knight of the Garter
followed, with an earl’s coronet, and in 1735 the great Lord
Peterborough acknowledged his marriage with that daughter of
sweet sounds, Anastasia Robinson. This example at once flattered,
provoked, and stimulated the ladies, one of whom, the daughter
of Earl de Waldegrave, Lady Henrietta Herbert, married young
Beard the actor. This was thought “low,” and another knight’s
daughter was less censured for marrying her father’s footman.
The “Beggars’ Opera” gave two coronets to two Pollys. Lavinia
Fenton (Betswick), the original Polly at Lincoln’s Inn, in 1728,
became Duchess of Bolton a few years later; and in 1813, no
less a man than Lord Thurlow married Mary Catherine Bolton,
who was scarcely an inferior <i>Polly</i> to the original lady, who gave
up <i>Polly</i> to become a Bolton.</p>

<p>The squires once more took their turn when Sheridan married
Miss Lindley; but before the last century closed, Miss Farren
gave her hand to “the proudest earl in England,” the Earl of
Derby, Knight of the Bath. In 1807, knight and squire took two
ladies from the stage. In that year Mr. Heathcote married the
beautiful Miss Searle; and Earl Craven married Louisa Brunton.
We have still among us five ex-actresses who married men of the
degree of noble, knight, or squire. These are Miss Stephens, the
widowed Countess of Essex; Miss Foote, the widowed Countess of
Harrington; Miss O’Neill the widow of Sir William Beecher, Bart.;
Mrs. Nisbett, the relict of the bold Sir Felix Boothby; and Miss
M. Tree, whose late husband, Mr. Bradshaw, was at one time
M. P. for Canterbury.</p>

<p>There is something romantic in the lives of all these ladies, but
most in that of “Lizzy Farren,” and as the life of that lady of a
Knight of the Bath has something in common with the career of
a celebrated legal knight and judge, I will take some of its incidents
as the chief points in the following sketch, which is a supplementary
chapter to the Romance of History, and perhaps not
the least interesting one in such a series.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span></p>

<p>If gayety consists in noise, then was the market-place of Salisbury,
toward the close of Christmas Eve, 1769, extremely joyous
and glad. In the centre, on a raised stage, his Worship the Mayor
was inaugurating the holyday-time, by having a bout at single-stick
with an itinerant exhibitor of the art of self-defence from
London. The “professor” had been soliciting the magisterial
permission to set up his stage in the market-place, and he had
not only received full license, but the chief magistrate himself condescended
to take a stick and try his strength with the professor.</p>

<p>It was an edifying sight, and bumpkins and burgesses enjoyed it
consumedly. The professional fencer allowed his adversary to
count many “hits” out of pure gratitude. But he had some self-respect,
and in order that his reputation might not suffer in the
estimation of the spectators, he wound up the “set-to” by dealing
a stroke on the right-worshipful skull, which made the mayor imagine
that chaos was come again, and that all about him was
dancing confusedly into annihilation.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I have accidentally hurt your worship’s head,”
said the wickedly sympathizing single-stick player.</p>

<p>“H’m!” murmured the fallen great man, with a ghastly smile,
and Iris’s seven hues upon his cheek, “don’t mention it: there’s
nothing in it!”</p>

<p>“I am truly rejoiced,” replied the professor to his assistant,
with a wink of the eye, “that his worship has not lost his senses.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ay!” exclaimed the rough aide, “he’s about as wise as
ever he was.”</p>

<p>The single-stick player looked like Pizarro, who, when he <i>did</i>
kill a friend occasionally—“his custom i’ th’ afternoon”—always
went to the funeral in a mourning suit and a droop of the eye—intended
for sympathy. In the meantime the mayor, who had
been fancying himself in a balloon, and that he was being whirled
away from his native town, began to think that the balloon was
settling to earth again, and that the representation of chaos had
been indefinitely deferred. He continued, however, holding on by
the rail, as if the balloon was yet unsteady, and he only complained
of a drumming in the ears.</p>

<p>At that moment the not-to-be-mistaken sound of a real drum
fell in harsh accompaniment upon his singing-ears, and it had one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
good effect, that of bringing back the magistrate and the man.
Both looked through the rather shaken windows of the one body,
and indignation speedily lighted up from within.</p>

<p>The sound came from the suburb of Fisherton, but it swelled
insultingly nearer and nearer, as though announcing that it was
about to be beaten in the borough, despite the lack of magisterial
sanction. The great depository of authority began to gaze in
speechless horror, as the bearer of the noisy instrument made
his appearance in the market-place at the head of a small procession,
which was at once seen to consist of a party of strolling actors.</p>

<p>The drummer was a thick-set man, with nothing healthy looking
about him but his nose, and that looked <i>too</i> healthy. He was
the low comedian, and was naturally endowed to assume that distinctive
line.</p>

<p>He was followed by three or four couple of “the ladies and gentlemen
of the company,” of some of whom it might be said, that
shoes were things they did not much stand upon. They had a
shabby genteel air about them, looked hungry and happy; and
one or two wore one hand in the pocket, upon an economizing
principle in reference to gloves. The light comedian cut jokes
with the spectators, and was soon invited to the consequence he
aimed at—an invitation to “take a glass of wine.” The women
were more tawdry-looking than the men, but they wore a light-hearted,
romping aspect—all, except the young lady who played
Ophelia and Columbine, who carried a baby, and looked as if she
had not been asleep since it was born, which was probably the case.</p>

<p>The <i>cortège</i> was closed by a fine, gentleman-like man, who led
by the hand a little girl some ten years old. No one could look
for a moment at them, without at once feeling assured that there
was something in them which placed them above the fellows with
whom they consorted. They were father and daughter. <i>He</i>
manager; <i>she</i> a species of infant phenomenon. In his face were
to be traced the furrows of disappointment, and in his eye the
gleam of hope. <i>Her</i> face was as faces of the young should ever
be, full of enjoyment, love, and feeling. The last two were especially
there for the father, whose hand she held, and into whose
face she looked, ever and anon, with a smile which never failed to
be repaid in similar currency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span></p>

<p>The refined air of the father, and the graceful bearing of the
modest daughter, won commendations from all beholders. He
was an ex-surgeon of Cork, who had given up his profession in
order to follow the stage. People set him down as insane, and so
he was, but it was an insanity which made a countess of his
daughter. His name was Farren, and his child, pet daughter of
a pretty mother, was the inimitable Lizzy.</p>

<p>If the mayor could have read into history, he would have knelt
down and kissed Lizzy Farren’s shoe-buckles. As he could not
so read, he only saw in the sire a vagabond, and in the child a
mountebank. On the former he hurled down the whole weight
of his magisterial wrath. It was in vain that the manager declared
he was on his way to solicit the mayor’s license to act in Salisbury.
That official gentleman declared that it was an infraction of the
law to pass from the suburb of Fisherton into the borough of
Salisbury before the mayor’s permission had been previously
signified.</p>

<p>“And that permission I will never give,” said his worship.
“We are a godly people here, and have no taste for rascal-players.
As his majesty’s representative, I am bound to encourage no
amusements that are not respectable.”</p>

<p>“But our young king,” interrupted Mr. Farren, “is himself a
great patron of the theatre.”</p>

<p>This was worse than a heavy blow at single-stick; and the
mayor was the more wrath as he had no argument ready to meet
it. After looking angry for a moment, a bright thought struck
him.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir! You will not, I hope, teach a mayor either fact
or duty. We know, sir, what the king (God bless him!) patronizes.
His majesty does not patronize strollers. He goes regularly
to an <i>established</i> church, sir, and to an <i>established</i> theatre; and so,
sir, I, as mayor, support only establishments. Good heavens!
what would become of the throne and the altar, if a Mayor of
Sarum were to do otherwise?”</p>

<p>As Mr. Farren did not well know, he could not readily tell;
and as he stood mute, the mayor continued to pour down upon
the player and his vocation, a shower of obloquy. At every allusion
which he made to his predilection for amusements that were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
respectable and instructive, the single-stick player and his man
drew themselves up, cried “<i>Hear! hear!</i>” and looked down upon
the actors with an air of burlesque contempt. The actors, men
and women, returned the look with a burst of uncontrollable
laughter. The mayor took this for deliberate insult, aimed at himself
and at what he chose to patronize. His protégés looked the
more proud, and became louder than ever in their self-applauding
“<i>Hear! hear!</i>” The players, the while, shrieked with laughter.
Even Mr. Farren and Lizzy could not refrain from risibility, for
the stick-player and his man were really members of the company.
The former was Mr. Frederick Fitzmontague, who was great in
<i>Hamlet</i>. His man was the ruffian in melodramas, and the clown
in pantomimes, and as he did a little private business of his own
by accepting an engagement from a religious society, during the
dull season of the year, to preach on the highways against theatricals,
Mr. Osmond Brontere was usually known by the cognomen
of Missionary Jack.</p>

<p>The magisterial refusal to license this wandering company to
play in Salisbury, was followed by altercation; and altercation by
riot. The multitude took part with the actors, and they hooted
the mayor; and the latter, viewing poor Farren as the cause and
guilty mover of all that had occurred, summarily ordered his arrest;
and, in spite of all remonstrance, resistance, or loudly-expressed
disgust, the manager was ultimately lodged in the cage.
The mob, then, satisfied at having had a little excitement, and
caring nothing more about the matter, at length separated, and repaired
to their respective homes. They went all the quicker that
the rain had begun to descend in torrents; and they took little notice
of poor Lizzy, who went home in the dusk, weeping bitterly,
and led by the hands of the matronly Ophelia and Missionary
Jack.</p>

<p>Ere morning dawned, a change had come over the scene. The
rain had ceased. A hard frost had set in. All Salisbury looked
as if it were built upon a frozen lake. The market-place itself
was a <i>mer de glace</i>. Christmas-day was scarcely visible when a
boy of early habits, standing at the door of an upholsterer’s shop,
which bore above it the name of Burroughs, fancied he saw something
moving with stealthy pace across the market-place; and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
amused himself by watching it through the gloom. It was developed,
after a while, into the figure of a thinly-clad girl, bearing in
her arms a bowl of hot milk. She trod cautiously, and looked,
now down at her feet, now across the wide square, to measure the
distance she had yet to go. Each little foot was put forward with
hesitation, and so slowly was progress made, that there was good
chance of the boiling milk being frozen, before it had been carried
half-way to its destination.</p>

<p>The girl was Lizzy Farren, and in the bowl, which between her
arms looked as graceful as urn clasped by Arcadian nymph, lay
the chief portion of a breakfast destined, on this sad Christmas
morning, for her captive sire in the cage.</p>

<p>“She’ll be down!” said young Burroughs, as he saw her partially
slip. Lizzy, however, recovered herself; but so alarmed
was she at her situation, so terrified when she measured the distance
she had to accomplish by that which she had already traversed,
that she fairly stood still near the centre of the market-place,
and wept aloud over the hot bowl and her cold position. It was
then that the young knight recognised the crisis when he was
authorized to interfere. He made a run from the door, shot one
leg in advance, drew the other quickly after him, and went sliding,
with express-train speed, close up to Lizzy’s feet. <i>She</i> no sooner
saw the direful prospect of collision than she shrieked with an energy
which roused all the rooks in the close.</p>

<p>“Hold hard!” exclaimed the merry-faced boy; “hold hard!
that’s myself, you Lizzy, and the milk. Hold hard!” he continued,
as he half held her up, half held on to her. “Hold hard! or we
shall all be down together.”</p>

<p>“Oh, where do you come from? and how do you know my
name is Lizzy?”</p>

<p>“Well! Mr. Fitzmontague lodges in our house, and he told us
all about you, last night. And he said, as sure as could be, you
would be awake before anybody in Salisbury. And sure enough,
here you are, almost before daylight.”</p>

<p>By the help of the young cavalier, the distressed damsel was
relieved from her perplexity. Young Burroughs offered to carry
the bowl, which she stoutly refused. “No one,” she said, “shall
carry my father’s breakfast to him, but myself, on such a morning.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
And so, her deliverer walked tenderly by her side, holding her
cautiously up, nor ceased from his care, until Lizzy and her burden
had safely reached the cage. Through the bars of the small window,
Farren had watched her coming; and he hailed her arrival
with a “God bless you, my own child!”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa!” said Lizzy, weeping again, and embracing the
bowl as warmly as if it had been her father himself; “oh, papa!
what would mamma and my little sisters, and all our friends in
Liverpool say, if they knew how we are beginning our Christmas
day?”</p>

<p>“Things unknown are unfelt, my darling. We will tell them
nothing about it, till Fortune gilds over the memory of it. But
what do you bring, Lizzy?—or rather, why do I ask? It is my
breakfast; and Lizzy herself has had none.”</p>

<p>A pretty altercation ensued; but Lizzy gained her point; and
not one drop would she taste till her sire had commenced the repast.
Aided by young Burroughs, she held the lip of the bowl
through the bars of the cage; and the little English maiden smiled,
for the first time since yesterday, at beholding her sire imbibe the
quickening draught. It was not till three years after that Barry
and his wife played Evander and Euphrasia in the Grecian
Daughter, or Farren would have drawn a parallel suitable to the
occasion. He was not so well up in history as in theatricals; and
on the stage, history has a terrible time of it. Witness this very
tragedy in which Murphy has made Evander, King of Sicily, and
confounded Dionysius the elder, with his younger namesake. To
be sure, pleasant Palmer, who played the character, was about as
wise as Murphy.</p>

<p>When the primitive breakfast was concluded, Lizzy stood sad
and silent; and the father sadly and silently looked down at her;
while young Burroughs leaned against the wall, as sad and silent
as either of them. And so a weary two hours passed; at the end
of which, a town-constable appeared, accompanied by a clerical
gentleman, and empowered to give liberty to the captive. When
the constable told the manager that his liberation was owing to
the intercession made in his behalf, by the Reverend Mr. Snodgrass,
who had just arrived in Salisbury, Lizzy clapped her hands
with agitation, for she saw that the clerical interceder was no other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
than Missionary Jack. “Oh, Mr. Brontere,” said the curious girl,
when they had all reached home together, “how did you ever
manage it?”</p>

<p>“Well!” said the enterprising actor, with a laugh; “I called on
his worship, to inquire what Christmas charities might be acceptable;
and if there were any prisoners whom my humble means
might liberate. He named your papa, and the company have
paid what was necessary. His worship was not inexorable, particularly
as I incidentally told him his Majesty patronized, the
other day, an itinerant company at Datchet. As for <i>how</i> I did it.
I rather think I am irresistible in the dress in which poor Will
Havard, only two years ago, played ‘Old Adam.’ A little ingenuity,
as you see, has made it look very like a rector’s costume;
and, besides,” said Missionary Jack, “I sometimes think that nature
intended me for the church.”</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>Three years had elapsed. On the Christmas eve of 1772, all
the play-going people of Wakefield were in a state of pleasant excitement,
at the promise made in bills posted over the town announcing
the immediate appearance of the “Young Queen of
Columbines.” All the young bachelors of the town were besieging
the box-office. In those days there were not only theatres in
provincial towns, but people really went to them. Amid the applicants,
was a sprightly-looking articled clerk, who, having
achieved his object, had stopped for a moment at the stage-door to
read the programme of the forthcoming pantomime. While thus
engaged the Columbine Queen, the most fairy-looking of youthful
figures, brilliant as spring, and light as gossamer, sweet fifteen,
with a look of being a year or two more, tripped into the street,
on her way home from rehearsal. Eighty years ago the gallantry
of country towns, with respect to pretty actresses, was much like
that which characterizes German localities now. It was of a
rudely enthusiastic quality. Accordingly, the fairy-looking Columbine
had hardly proceeded a dozen yards, when she had twice
as many offers made her of arms, whereon to find support over
the slippery pavement. It was an old-fashioned winter in Wakefield,
and Columbine’s suitors had as many falls in the course of
their assiduities, as though they had been so many “Lovers” in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
the pantomime, and the wand of Harlequin was tripping them up
as they skipped along. Columbine got skilfully rid of them all in
time, except one; and <i>he</i> became at last so unwelcomely intrusive,
that the articled clerk, who was the very champion of distressed
damsels, and had been a watcher of what was going on, went up
to the young lady, took her arm in his, without any ceremony, and
bade her persecutor proceed any further, at his peril. The gentleman
took the hint, and left knight and lady to continue their
way unmolested. They no sooner saw themselves alone, when,
looking into each other’s faces, they laughed a merry laugh of recognition,
and it would be difficult to say which was the merrier—Miss
Farren or Mr. Burroughs, the young actress and the incipient
lawyer.</p>

<p>When boxing-night came, there was a crowded house, and
Lizzy created a <i>furore</i>. Like Carlotta Grisi, she could sing as
well as dance, and there was a bright intellect, to boot, pervading
all she did. On the night in question, she sang between the acts;
and young Burroughs, ever watchful, especially marked the effect
of her singing upon a very ecstatic amateur who was seated next
to him. “What a treasure,” said the amateur, “would this girl
be in Liverpool!” “Well,” remarked Burroughs, “I am ready
to accept an engagement for her. State your terms. Thirty
shillings a-week, I presume, will not quite exhaust your treasury.”
“I will certainly,” said the stranger, “tell our manager, Younger,
of the prize which is to be acquired so cheaply; and the affair
need not be delayed; for Younger is at the Swan, and will be
down here to-night, to see the pantomime.”</p>

<p>In five minutes, Burroughs was sitting face-to-face with Younger
at the inn, urging him to go at once, not to see Columbine dance,
but to hear her sing. “I wonder,” said the manager, “if your
young friend is the child of the Cork surgeon who married the
daughter of Wright, the Liverpool brewer. If so, she’s clever;
besides, why——”</p>

<p>“Why she’ll make your fortune,” said the lawyer’s clerk.
“She is the grand-daughter of your Liverpool brewer, sings like
a nightingale, and is worth five pounds a week to you at least.
Come and hear her.”</p>

<p>Younger walked leisurely down, as if he was in no particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
want of talent; but he was so pleased with what he did hear that
when the songstress came off the stage, Burroughs went round
and exultingly announced that he had procured an engagement
for her at Liverpool, at two pounds ten per week; and to find her
own satin shoes and silk stockings. In prospect of such a Potosi,
the Columbine danced that night as boundingly as if Dan Mercury
had lent her the very pinions from his heels.</p>

<p>“Mr. Burroughs,” said Lizzy, as he was escorting her and her
mother home, “this is the second Christmas you have made happy
for us. I hope you may live to be Lord Chief Justice.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Lizzy, that is about as likely as that Liverpool
will make of the Wakefield Columbine a countess.”</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>A few years had again passed away since the Christmas week
which succeeded that spent at Wakefield, and which saw Lizzy
Farren the only <i>Rosetta</i> which Liverpool cared to listen to, and it
was now the same joyous season, but the locality was Chester.</p>

<p>There was a custom then prevailing among actors, which exists
nowhere now, except in some of the small towns in Germany.
Thus, not very long ago, at Ischl, in Austria, I was surprised to
see a very pretty actress enter my own room at the inn, and
putting a play-bill into my hand, solicit my presence at her benefit.
This was a common practice in the north of England till
Tate Wilkinson put an end to it, as derogatory to the profession.
The custom, however, had not been checked at the time and in
the locality to which I have alluded. On the Christmas eve of
the period in question, Lizzy Farren was herself engaged in distributing
her bills, and asking patronage for her benefit, which
was to take place on the following Twelfth Night. As appropriate
to the occasion she had chosen Shakespeare’s comedy of that
name, and was to play <i>Viola</i>, a part for which Younger, who
loved her heartily, had given her especial instruction.</p>

<p>Miss Farren had not been very successful in her “touting.” She
had been unlucky in the two families at whose houses she had
ventured to knock. The first was that of an ex-proprietor of a
religious periodical, who had a horror of the stage, but who had
a so much greater horror of Romanism, that, like the Scottish
clergy of the time, he would have gone every night to the play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
during Passion week, only to show his abhorrence of popery.
This pious scoundrel had grown rich by swindling his editors and
supporting any question which paid best. His household he kept
for years, by inserting advertisements in his journal for which
he was paid in kind. He was a slimy, sneaking, mendacious
knave, who would have advocated atheism if he could have procured
a dozen additional subscribers by it. His lady was the
quintessence of vulgarity and malignity. She wore diamonds on
her wig, venom in her heart, and very-much-abused English at
the end of her tongue.</p>

<p>Poor Lizzy, rebuffed here, rang at the garden-gate of Mrs.
Penury Beaugawg. She was a lady of sentiment who drank, a
lady of simplicity who rouged, a lady of affected honesty who
lived beyond her income, and toadied or bullied her relations into
paying her debts. Mrs. Penury Beaugawg would have graciously
accepted orders for a private box; but a patronage which cost
her anything, was a vulgarity which her gentle and generous spirit
could not comprehend.</p>

<p>Lizzy was standing dispirited in the road at the front of the
house, when a horseman rode slowly up; and Lizzy, not at all
abashed at practising an old but not agreeable custom, raised a
bill to his hand as he came close to her, and solicited half-a-crown,
the regular admission-price to the boxes.</p>

<p>“Lizzy!” cried the horseman, “you shall have such a house at
Chester, as the old town has not seen since the night Garrick was
here, and played <i>Richard</i> and <i>Lord Chalkstone</i>.”</p>

<p>The equestrian was Mr. Burroughs, then in training for
the bar, and as willing to help Miss Farren now as he was
to aid her and her bowl of milk across the market-place at
Salisbury. The incipient barrister kept his word. The
Chester theatre was crammed to the ceiling; and, as Lizzy
said, Mr. Burroughs was her Christmas angel, the thought of
whom was always associated in her mind with plumbs, currants,
holly——</p>

<p>“And mistletoe,” said the budding counsellor, with a look at
which both laughed merrily and honestly.</p>

<p>On the Christmas eve of 1776, Miss Farren was seated in
Colman’s parlor in London, looking at him while he read two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
letters of introduction; one from Burroughs, the other from
Younger; and both in high praise of the young bearer, for whom
they were especially written. My limits will only allow me to
say that Lizzy was engaged for the next summer-season at the
Haymarket, where she appeared on June 9, 1777, in “She Stoops
to Conquer.” She was <i>Miss Hardcastle</i>, and Edwin made his
first appearance in London with her, in the same piece. Colman
would have brought out Henderson too, if he could have managed
it. That dignified gentleman, however, insisted on reserving his
<i>début</i> for <i>Shylock</i>, on the 11th of the same month. And what a
joyous season did Lizzy make of it for our then youthful grandfathers.
How they admired her double talent in <i>Miss Hardcastle</i>!
How ecstatic were they with her <i>Maria</i>, in the “Citizen!”
How ravishedly did they listen to her <i>Rosetta</i>! How they
laughed at her <i>Miss Tittup</i>, in “Bon Ton!” and how they extolled
her playfulness and dignity as <i>Rosina</i>, of which she was
the original representative, in the “Barber of Seville!” It may
be remarked that Colman omitted the most comic scene in the
piece, <i>that</i> wherein the Count is disguised as a drunken trooper—as
injurious to morality!</p>

<p>When, in the following year, she played Lady Townley, she
was declared the first, and she was then almost the youngest of
living actresses. And when she joined the Drury Lane company
in the succeeding season, the principal parts were divided between
herself, Miss Walpole, Miss P. Hopkins, and <i>Perdita</i> Robinson.
Not one of this body was then quite twenty years of age! Is
not this a case wherein to exclaim—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“O mihi præteritos referat si Jupiter annos?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Just twenty years did she adorn our stage; ultimately taking
leave of it at Drury Lane, in April, 1797, in the character of
Lady Teazle. Before that time, however, she had been prominent
in the Christmas private plays at the Duke of Richmond’s,
in which the Earl of Derby, Lord Henry Fitzgerald, and the
Honorable Mrs. Dormer acted with her; and that rising barrister,
Mr. Burroughs, looking constantly at the judicial bench as his
own proper stage, was among the most admiring of the audience.
It was there that was formed that attachment which ultimately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
made of her, a month after she had retired from the stage, Countess
of Derby, and subsequently mother of a future countess, who still
wears her coronet.</p>

<p>Not long after this period, and following on her presentation
at Court, where she was received with marked kindly condescension
by Queen Charlotte, the countess was walking in the
marriage procession of the Princess Royal and the Duke of
Wurtemberg; her foot caught in the carpeting, and she would have
fallen to the ground, but for the ready arms, once more extended
to support her, of Mr. Burroughs, now an eminent man indeed.</p>

<p>Many years had been added to the roll of time, when a carriage,
containing a lady was on its way to Windsor. It suddenly came
to a stop, by the breaking of an axle-tree. In the midst of the
distress which ensued to the occupier, a second carriage approached,
bearing a goodnatured-looking gentleman, who at once
offered his services. The lady, recognising an old friend, accepted
the offer with alacrity. As the two drove off together in
the gentleman’s carriage toward Windsor, the owner of it remarked
that he had almost expected to find her in distress on
the road; for it was Christmas Eve, and he had been thinking
of old times.</p>

<p>“How many years is it, my lady countess,” said he, “since I
stood at my father’s shop-door in Salisbury, watching your perilous
passage over the market-place, with a bowl of milk?”</p>

<p>“Not so long at all events,” she answered with a smile, “but
that I recollect my poor father would have lost his breakfast, but
for your assistance.”</p>

<p>“The time is not long for memory,” replied the Judge, “nor is
Salisbury as far from Windsor as Dan from Beersheba; yet how
wide the distance between the breakfast at the cage-door at Salisbury,
and the Christmas dinner to which we are both proceeding,
in the palace of the king!”</p>

<p>“The earl is already there,” added the countess, “and he will
be happier than the king himself to welcome the legal knight who
has done such willing service to the Lady of the Knight of the
Bath.”</p>

<p>To those whose power and privilege it is to create such knights,
we will now direct our attention, and see how kings themselves
behaved in <i>their</i> character as knights.</p>

</div>

<p class="c sp less">FROM THE NORMANS TO THE STUARTS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Un roi abstrait n’est ni père, ni fils, ni frère, ni parent, ni chevalier,
ami. Qu’est il donc? <i>Roi</i>, même quand il dort.”— <span class="smcap">Diderot.</span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">If</span> we judge some of our kings by the strict laws of chivalry,
we shall find that they were but sorry knights after all. They
may have been terrible in battle; but they were ill-mannerly in
ladies’ bower.</p>

<p>William the Conqueror, for instance, had none of the tender sentiment
of chivalry; in other words he showed little gentleness in his
bearing toward women. It is said by Ingerius, that after Matilda of
Flanders had refused his hand, on the ground that she would not have
a bastard for a husband, he waylaid her as she was returning from
mass in one of the streets of Bruges, dragged her out from among
her ladies, pommelled her brutally, and finally rolled her in the
mud. A little family difference arose in consequence; but as it
was less bitter than family quarrels usually are, a reconciliation
took place, and Matilda gave her hand to the knight who had so
terribly bruised her with his arm. She loved him, she said, because
he had shown more than the courage of common knights, by
daring to beat her within sight of her father’s own palace. But
all’s well that ends well; they were not only a handsome but a
happy couple, and Matilda was head of the household at the Conqueror’s
hearth. The general’s wife was <i>there</i> the general.</p>

<p>How William bore himself in fight is too well known to need
recapitulating here. He probably never knew fear but once, and
that was at the sounds of a tumult in the street, which reached his
ears as he was being crowned. Then, indeed, “’tis true this god<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
did shake,” for the first and only time. His successor, who was
knighted by Archbishop Lanfranc, was in the field as good a
knight as he, and generous to an adversary, although he was never
so to any mortal besides. But Rufus was nothing of a knight in
his bearing toward ladies. His taste with regard to the fair sex
was of the worst sort; and the court of this royal and reprobate
bachelor was a reproach at once to kingship and knighthood, to
Christianity and civilization. He had been accused, or rather the
knights of his time and country, with having introduced into England
the practice of a crime of which the real introducer, according
to others, was that Prince William who was drowned so fortunately
for England, on the sea between Calais and Dover. The chivalrous
magnanimity of Rufus is exemplified in the circumstance of his
having, in disguise, attacked a cavalier, from whom he received so
sound a beating, that he was at length compelled to avow himself
in order to induce his conqueror to spare his life. The terrified
victor made an apology, in the very spirit of the French knight
of the Holy Ghost to a dying cavalier of the Golden Spur, whom
he had mortally wounded in mistake: “I beg a thousand pardons,”
said the polite Frenchman, “but I really took you for somebody
else.” So William’s vanquisher began to excuse himself for
having nearly battered the king’s skull to a jelly, with his battle-axe,
on the ground of his having been unacquainted with his rank.
“Never heed the matter,” said the king, “you are a good fellow,
and shall, henceforth, be a follower of mine.” Many similar instances
might be cited. Further, Rufus was highly popular with
all men-at-arms; the knights reverenced him as the very flower
of chivalry, and I am glad that the opprobrium of having slain
him in the New Forest no longer attaches itself to a knight, although
I am sorry an attempt has been made to fix it upon the
church. No one now believes that Sir Walter Tyrrel was the
author of the crime, and chivalry is acquitted of the charge against
one of its members of having slain the flaxen-haired but rubicund-nosed
king.</p>

<p>Henry Beauclerc was more of a scholar than a knight, without,
however, being so very much of the first. The English-born
prince was far less chivalrous of spirit than his former brother
Robert; that is, if not less brave, he was less generous, especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
to a foe. When he was besieged on St. Michael’s Mount by
Robert, and reduced to such straits that he was near dying of thirst,
Robert supplied him with water; an act for which Rufus called
the doer of it a fool; but as poor Robert nobly remarked, the
quarrel between him and their brother was not of such importance
that he should be made to perish of thirst. “We may have occasion,”
said he, “for a brother hereafter; but where shall we find
one, if we now destroy this?” Henry would hardly have imitated
conduct so chivalrously generous. He was more knightly
in love, and it is recorded to his honor, that he married Matilda,
daughter of Malcolm, King of Scotland, for pure love, and not for
“filthy lucre,” preferring to have her without a marriage portion,
than to wait till one could be provided for her. This would have
been praiseworthy enough had Henry not been, subsequently, like
many other persons who marry in haste—for ever looking for
pecuniary assistance from other resources than his own. He
especially lacked too what was enjoined on every knight, a love
of truth. His own promises were violated with alacrity, when
the violation brought profit. He wanted, too, the common virtue
of fidelity, which men of knightly rank were supposed to possess
above all others. The fact that fifteen illegitimate children survived
him, speaks little for his respect for either of his consorts,
Matilda of Scotland, or Adelicia of Louvain. Generally speaking,
however, the character of the royal scholar may be described
in any terms, according to the view in which it is taken. With
some historians, he is all virtue, with others all vice.</p>

<p>Stephen had more of the knightly character about him. He
was an accomplished swordsman, and loved the sound of battle as
became the spirit of the times, which considered the king as the
first knight in the land. He had as little regard as Henry for a
sense of justice when disposed to seize upon that to which he had
no right, but he was incontestably brave, as he was indefensibly
rash. Stephen received the spurs of knighthood from his uncle,
Henry I., previous to the battle of Tinchebray; and in that fray
he so bore himself as to show that he was worthy of the honor
that had been conferred upon him. But Stephen was as faithless
to his marriage vow as many other belted knights, and Matilda of
Boulogne had to mourn over the faithlessness of one who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
sworn to be faithful. It is said, too, of this king that he always
went into battle terribly arrayed. This was in the spirit of those
birds that raise their crests to affright their enemies.</p>

<p>Henry II., like his brother kings, we can only consider in his
character of knight. In this character he is almost unexceptionable,
which is more than can be said of him generally as king or
as man. He was brave and generous, two chief characteristics
of knighthood. He it was who abolished that burdensome and
unprofitable feudal military service, which brought the barons or
military tenants into the field, for forty days. The camp consequently
abounded in unskilful and disorderly men. Henry accordingly
introduced the practice of commuting their military service
for money, by levying scutages from his baronies and knights-fees,
or so much for every shield or bearer of it that <i>should</i> attend
but had purchased exemption.</p>

<p>Henry II., not only loved knightly practice himself, but he
loved to see his sons exercising knight-errantry, and wandering
about in disguise from court to court, displaying their prowess in
tournaments, and carrying off prizes from all adversaries. To the
stories of these adventures of his by no means exemplary sons he
would listen with delight. He was himself, however, a sire who
set but indifferent example to his children; and his two sons, of
whom fair Rosamond was the mother, were brought up and educated
with his children by Eleanor. He received much knightly
service and true affection from his illegitimate children. William,
Earl of Salisbury, is known by his chivalric surname of “Longsword,”
but Geoffrey, Bishop of Lincoln, the second son of Henry
and Rosamond, was not the less a knight for being a bishop before
he was twenty. It was this prelate who, at the head of an armed
force put down the first great northern insurrection. He was on
his triumphant way back, at the head of one hundred and forty
knights, when he was met by his royal sire, who embraced him
warmly, exclaiming the while, “Thou alone art my legitimate
son, the rest are all bastards.” That he himself could endure
much was evinced when he submitted to correction at the shrine
of Becket. He was flagellated by the prelates, abbots, bishop, and
eighty monks; and the first refreshment he took after the long penance,
was some water in which a portion of Becket’s blood was mingled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
His claim to be considered chivalrous never suffered, in the
mind of the church at least, because of this humiliating submission.</p>

<p>But in the dissensions which led to this humiliation, the church
incurred perhaps more disgrace than the king. Nothing could
possibly be more disgraceful than the conduct of the pope and
the diplomacy of the Roman government throughout the continuation
of the quarrel between Becket and the king. Double-dealing,
atrocious deceit, and an unblushing disregard for truth, marked
every act of him who was looked upon as the spiritual head of
Christendom. Comparing Becket with the king, it is impossible to
avoid coming to the conclusion that, in many of the requirements
of knighthood, he was superior to the sovereign. His death, that is
the way in which he met it, was sublime. Throughout the great
quarrel, of which that death was a consequence, Becket never,
like Henry, in his moments of defeat and discouragement, gave
way to such impotent manifestations of rage as were shown by his
royal antagonist. The latter forgot the dignity, not only of knight,
but of manhood, when he was seen casting his cap violently to the
earth, flinging away his belt, tearing his clothes from his body, and
dragging the silk coverlet from his bed, on which, in presence of
his captains, he rolled himself like a maniac, grasping the mattress
in his mouth, and gnawing the wool and the horsehair which he
drew out with his teeth.</p>

<p>Richard I. has a brilliant reputation as a knight, and if valor
were the only virtue required, he would not be undeserving of the
pre-eminence which is claimed for him. But this was his sole
virtue. Of the other qualifications for, or qualities of chivalry,
he knew nothing, or little cared for them. He was faithless in
love; regardless of his pledged word; cruel, extravagant, dishonest;
and not even always brave, when away from the clamor and
excitements of war. But John lacked the one rough quality of
Richard, and was not even brave—that is to say, he was not distinguishedly
brave. When he stole away Isabella of Angoulême from
her first lover, Sir Hugh de Lusignan, it was not done with the
dashing gallantry of Young Lochinvar. John, in fact, was a shabby
and recreant knight; and when stout Sir Hugh challenged him to
single combat, because of his crime of abduction, John offered to
accept it by deputy, and to fight also by deputy. Sir Hugh knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
the craven prince thoroughly, and truly enough remarked that the
deputy would be a mere assassin, and he would have nothing to
do with either principal or representative. John kept the lady;
and, if there be any persons curious to see how niggardly he kept
her, they are referred to the duly-published chronicles wherein
there are full details.</p>

<p>Henry III. was the most pacifically-minded of the kings of
England who had hitherto reigned. He had little of the knight
about him, except the courtesy, and he could occasionally forget
even that. Devotion to the fair, too, may fairly be reckoned
among his knightly qualities; but he lacked the crowning virtue
of fidelity. He wooed many, was rejected by several, and jilted
the few who believed in him. He exhibited, it must be allowed,
a chivalrous generosity in at last marrying Eleanor of Castile,
without dowry; but he was not the more true to her on that account.
Mild as he was by nature, he was the especial favorite
of the most warlike of the orders of knighthood—the Templars.
They mourned for him when dead, as though he had been the
very flower of chivalry, and the most approved master of their
order. They buried him, too, with a pomp which must have
drawn largely even on their well-lined purses, and the Knights
of the Temple deposited the king in the tomb of the most pious
of monarchs—Edward the Confessor. It is difficult to say why
the Templars had such love for the weak king, for he was not an
encourager of knightly associations and observations. At the same
time he may be said to have lowered the estimation in which
knighthood had been held, by making the honor itself cheap, and
sometimes even less than that—unwelcome. Henry III. issued
a writ in the twenty-ninth year of his reign, summoning tenants
in chief to come and receive knighthood at his hands: and tenants
of mesne lords to be knighted by whomsoever they pleased. It
may be believed that this last permission was abused, for soon
after this period “it became an established principle of our law
that no subject can confer knighthood except by the king’s authority.”
So says Hallam. The most extraordinary law or custom
of this reign with respect to chivalry was, that any man who possessed
an annual income of fifteen pounds derived from land, was
to be <i>compelled</i> to receive the honor of knighthood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span></p>

<p>The successor of Henry, Edward I., was of a far more knightly
quality. Faithful in love, intrepid in battle, generous to the needy,
and courteous to all—except when his temper was crossed—he
may pass muster as a very respectable knight. He was active
and strong, and, with one hand on the back of his steed, could
vault, at a single bound, into the saddle. Few men cared less for
finery. He was even reproved on one occasion by a bishop, for
being dressed beneath his dignity of either king or knight. “Father,”
said Edward, “what could I do more in royal robes than
in this plain gaberdine?”</p>

<p>Edward would have acted little in the spirit of a true knight
if he had really acted toward the Bards, according to the cruel
fashion recorded in history. I am inclined to believe with Davies,
in his “Mythology of the Druids,” that this king has been
calumniated in this respect. “There is not the name,” says Davies,
“of a single bard upon record who suffered either by his
hand or by his orders. His real act was the removal of that patronage,
under which the bards had, hitherto, cherished the heathenish
superstition of their ancestors, to the disgrace of our native
princes.” This king showed a feeling common with many knights,
that however indifferently they might look living, in rusty armor
or faded mantle, they should wear a decent and comely covering
when dead. Thus he ordered that every year his tomb should
be opened, and his remains covered with a new cere-cloth or pall.
It was a pride akin to that of Mrs. Oldfield’s, in the days of our
grandmothers, who was buried in a Brussels lace head-dress, a
Holland shift with tucker and double ruffles of the same lace, and
a pair of new kid gloves. The same weakness of nature marked
both the tragedy-queen and the actual king; and it marks many
more than they. There was more humility, however, in the second
Duke Richard of Normandy, who was far more chivalrous
than Edward I., and who ordered his body to be buried at the
church-door, where passengers might tread upon it, and the spouts
from the roof discharge their water upon it.</p>

<p>It was in the religious spirit of chivalry that Edward I. expelled
the Jews. One curious result is said to have followed. Report
alleges that many of the Jewish families fled into Scotland, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
“they have propagated ever since in great numbers; witness the
aversion this nation has above others to hog’s flesh.”</p>

<p>Of the unfortunate Edward II., it may be said that he was an
indifferent knight, who gave the honors of chivalry to very indifferent
persons, and committed great outrages on knightly orders
themselves. In the annals of knighthood he is remembered as the
monarch who abolished the Order of Knights Templars in England.
He treated the luckless chevaliers with far more generosity
than Henry VIII. observed toward the ejected monks and abbots.
He allowed two shillings per day to the deprived master
of the Temple, and fourpence each daily to the other knights for
their support, out of their former confiscated property. Edward
himself loved carousing and hunting, more than any other pastime.
There were other pleasures, indeed, in which he greatly delighted,
and these are well catalogued in one of Gaveston’s speeches in
Marlowe’s tragedy, called by this king’s name:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“I must have wanton poets, pleasant wits,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Musicians, that with touching of a string,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Music and poetry are his delight,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Such things as these best please his majesty.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How dearly he paid for indulgence in such pleasures, and how
meekly he accepted his fierce destiny or retribution, need not be
detailed here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span></p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of the character of Edward II. himself,
his chivalry wrought little good for the realm. The crown of
England during his reign was weaker; and as the knight-historian,
Sir J. Davies, remarks in his History of Ireland, “suffered
more dishonor in both kingdoms than at any time since the Norman
Conquest.” There were few such honest knights, too, in that
reign, as in that of the third Edward, when Sir Thomas Rookesby,
an eminent law-knight and judge, was wont to say that he
“would eat in wooden dishes, but would pay gold and silver for
his meat.” In this speech a blow was dealt at the extravagant
people who in order “to eat off plate,” made no scruple of cheating
their butcher.</p>

<p>In Edward III. we have a king who is more closely connected
with knightly associations in our memory than any other sovereign
of England. He it was who, by reviving or reconstructing the
ancient order, founded by Richard I., of “The Blue Thong”—a
leather knee-band, worn by certain of the English crusaders—formed
that brilliant Order of the Garter, which has been conferred
on so few who are deserving, and on so many whose
claims were not so great as their “pretensions.”</p>

<p>How far gallantry to the Countess of Salisbury had to do with
the renewing of the Order of the Blue Thong, under the name of
the Garter, is still an unsettled rather than a disputed point.
Froissart’s account is: “You have all heard how passionately
King Edward was smitten with the charms of the noble Lady
Katherine, Countess of Salisbury. Out of affection to the said
lady, and his desire to see her, he proclaimed a great feast, in
August, 1343. He commanded all his own lords and knights
should be there without fail, and he expressly ordered the Earl
of Salisbury to bring his lady, his wife, with as many young ladies
as she could collect to attend her. The Earl very cheerfully complied
with the king’s request, for he thought no evil, and his good
lady dared not to say nay. She came, however, much against her
will, for she guessed the reason which made the king so earnest
for her attendance, but was afraid to discover it to her husband,
intending by her conduct to make the king change his opinion....
All the ladies and damsels who assisted at the first convocation of
the Order of the Garter came superbly dressed, excepting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
Countess of Salisbury, who attended the festival, dressed as plainly
as possible; she did not wish the king to admire her, for she had no
intention to obey him in anything evil, that might tend to the dishonor
of her dear lord.” The repetition of the word <i>evil</i> here, has
probably nothing to do with the motto of the Garter, but I may
notice that when Froissart calls the above festival a convocation of
the order, he is in error, for, the first <i>chapter</i> of the Garter was
held at Windsor, on St. George’s Day, 1344. At this chapter
Queen Philippa was present in the robes of the order; for every
knight’s lady in the olden time shared in the knightly honors of
her lord.</p>

<p>How Edward bore himself in tournament and battle we all
know. Both historians and poets have rejoiced to exhibit this
chivalrous monarch as a lover, and he is even more interesting as
a knight in love than as one in war, and moreover as the account
of him in the former character reveals some other incidents of
knightly life, I will borrow Froissart’s historical picture of Edward
in a lady’s bower, and contrast therewith the picture of the same
monarch in the same circumstances, as depicted by the hands of a
poet. It is only necessary to premise that the lady who was the
object of Edward’s homage was Katherine de Granson, daughter
of a handsome, penniless knight, and a rich Wiltshire heiress
named Sibyl. “Katherine the fair,” says Miss Strickland, “was
the only child of this couple, and was richly endowed with her
mother’s wealth and her father’s beauty. She bestowed <i>both</i> on
the brave Earl of Salisbury”—who, if he was ugly as he was valiant,
must have been grateful for the gift of the beauty of William
de Granson.</p>

<p>When Edward wooed the countess, the earl was a prisoner in
France, and the lady’s castle of Wark had just been relieved from
siege laid against it by an army of Scots. “The moment the
countess heard the king’s approach she ordered all the gates to be
thrown open, and went out to meet him most richly dressed, insomuch
that no one could look at her, but with wonder and admiration
at her noble deportment and affability of behavior. When
she came near King Edward she made her obeisance to the ground,
and gave him thanks for coming to her assistance, and then conducted
him into the castle, to entertain and honor him, as she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
very capable of doing. Every one was delighted with her; but
the king could not take his eyes from her; so that a spark of fine
love struck upon his heart, which lasted for a long time, for he did
not believe that the whole world produced another such a lady, so
worthy of being beloved. Thus they entered the castle, hand in
hand. The countess led him first to the hall, and then to the best
chamber which was very richly furnished as belonging to so fine
a lady. King Edward kept his eyes so fixed upon the countess
that the gentle lady was quite abashed. After he had sufficiently
examined his apartment, he retired to a window, and leaning on it,
fell into a profound revery.</p>

<p>“The countess left him, to order dinner to be made ready, and
the table set, and the hall ornamented and set out; likewise to
welcome the knights and lords who accompanied the king. When
she had given all the orders to her servants she thought needful,
she returned with a cheerful countenance to King Edward and
said: ‘Dear sir, what are you musing on? Such meditation is
not proper for you, saving your grace! You ought rather to be
in high spirits, having freed England from her enemy without loss
of blood.’ The king replied, ‘Oh, dear lady, you must know
since I have been in this castle, some thoughts have oppressed
my mind that I was not before aware of, so that it behooves me to
reflect. Being uncertain what may be the event, I can not withdraw
my attention.’ ‘Dear sir,’ answered the lady, ‘you ought
to be of good cheer, and feast with your friends to give them more
pleasure, and leave off pondering, for God has been very bountiful
to you in your undertakings, so that you are the most feared and
renowned prince in Christendom. If the king of Scotland have
vexed you by the mischief he hath done in your kingdom, you
will speedily be able to make reprisals in his dominions. Therefore,
come, if it please you, into the hall to your knights, for your
dinner will soon be served.’ ‘Oh, sweet lady,’ said King Edward,
‘there be other things which touch my heart and lie heavy
there, than what you talk of. For in good truth, your beauteous
mien, and the perfection of your face and behavior have wholly
overcome me, and so deeply impress my heart, that my happiness
wholly depends on meeting a return to my flame, which no denial
from you can ever extinguish.’ ‘Oh, my dear lord,’ replied the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
countess, ‘do not amuse yourself by laughing at me with trying
to tempt me; for I can not believe you are in earnest as to what
you have just said. Is it likely that so gallant and noble a prince,
as you are, would ever think of dishonoring either me or my husband,
a valiant knight, who has served you so faithfully, and who
now lies in a doleful prison on your account? Certainly, sir, this
would not redound to your glory, nor would you be the better if
you could have your wayward will.’</p>

<p>“The virtuous lady then quitted the king, who was astonished
at her words. She went into the hall to hasten dinner; afterward
she approached the king’s chamber, attended by all the knights,
and said to him, ‘My lord king, your knights are all waiting for
you, to wash their hands, for they, as well as yourself, have fasted
too long.’ King Edward left his apartment, and came to the hall,
where, after he had washed his hands, he seated himself with his
knights at the dinner, as did the lady also; but the king ate very
little, and was the whole time pensive, casting his eyes, whenever
he had the opportunity, on the countess. Such behavior surprised
his friends, for they were not accustomed to it, never having
seen the like before in the king. They supposed it was his chagrin
at the departure of the Scots without a battle. The king remained
at the castle the whole day, without knowing what to do with himself.
Thus did he pass that day and a sleepless night, debating
the matter within his own heart. At daybreak he rose, drew out
his whole army, exercised his camp, and made ready to follow the
Scots. Upon taking leave of the countess he said, ‘My dear lady,
God preserve you safe till I return; and I pray that you will
think well of what I have said, and have the goodness to give me
a different answer.’ ‘My gracious liege,’ replied the countess,
‘God of his infinite goodness preserve you, and drive from your
noble heart such villanous thoughts, for I am, and ever shall be,
willing to serve you, but only in what is consistent with my honor
and with yours.’ The king left her, quite astonished at her answers.”
He was, in fact, a very villanous personage in these matters,
and looked for as much submission from those ladies on whom
he cast his eyes, as the Czar Nicholas did from the loyal ladies
whom that “copper captain” delighted to favor.</p>

<p>An unknown poet, of the period between 1590 and 1600, in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
historical play entitled “Edward III.” has reproduced this incident,
and worked it up for the stage—with some touches which
are probably warranted by facts, and which, for that reason alone,
render the passage worth transcribing.</p>

<p>The countess, naturally, has the best of the argument, and
shames the king. In this pleasant light is she presented by both
chronicler and poet, and the lady, chiefly to honor whom the Order
of the Garter was constructed upon the basis of the Order of the
Blue Thong, was worthy of all the distinctive homage that could
be rendered to her by knight or king.</p>

<p>Richard II., so fond of parade and pleasure, so refined and intellectual,
so affable at first, so despotic and absolute at last, till he
was superseded and then slain, is among the most melancholy of
knights and sovereigns. He was not heroic, for he was easily elevated
and easily depressed. He turned deadly pale on hearing,
in Ireland, of the landing of Henry Bolingbroke in England, and
that the Archbishop of Canterbury had preached in favor of the
usurper. He was eminently courageous, sang a roundelay as well
as any minstrel, and often made the roundelays he sung. He
looked little like a knight indeed when he traversed part of Wales
to Conway, disguised as a Franciscan friar; or flying from castle
to castle, having sorry lodging and little food. It was in the dress
and cowl of a monk that the once chivalrous Richard surrendered
himself to his cousin. In the army of that cousin, sent to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
Richard and his few faithful knights and squires who refused to
detach his device from their coats, was “Sir Henry Percy” (the
<i>Hotspur</i> of Shakespeare), “whom they held to be the best knight
in England.”</p>

<p>It was by persuasion of Hotspur’s father that Richard left Conway
for Flint, where he was made prisoner, and afterward conveyed
to Chester, the English knights of the opposite faction behaving
to him with most unchivalric rudeness. The unsceptred
monarch was first taken to Pickering, one of the most beautiful
spots in England, defaced by scenes of the greatest crimes, of
which place knights and nobles were the masters. Thence he
passed on to Leeds and Knaresborough Castle, where the king’s
chamber is still pointed out to visiters. Finally, he was carried
to “bloody Pomfret”—“fatal and ominous to noble peers.” Never,
it is said, did man look less like a knight than the unhappy king,
when he appeared before the drawbridge of Pontefract Castle.
Majestic still he was in feature, but the majesty was depressed by
such profound melancholy, that few could look upon the weeping
king without themselves shedding tears. If the picture of him at
this juncture might be metrically given in outline, the following
sketch might feebly render it:—</p>

<p>Of the chivalrous spirit of Henry IV. no one entertains a
doubt, and yet he once refused to accept a challenge. The challenger
was the Duke of Orleans, who had been Henry’s sworn
friend, accomplice in some of his deeds, and who, failing to realize
all the advantages he expected, urged Henry to meet him in the
marches of Guienne, with a hundred knights on each side. Henry
fenced with the challenge rather than with the challenger, but
when the latter called him rebel, usurper, and murderer, he gave
his former friend the lie, in no very gentle terms, as regarded the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
charge of being accessory to the death of Richard. The little
flower, the Forget-me-not, owes some of its popularity to Henry,
who, previous to his being king, and when in exile, chose it for
his symbol, wore it in gold on his collar, and added to it by way
of device, the words “Souvenez de moi.” It is worthy of observation
that, after Henry’s death, his widow, Joanna of Navarre,
continued to be recognised as a lady of the Garter, receiving
presents from Henry V. as such, and being in attendance on high
festivals, in robes of the order, the gift of the new king.</p>

<p>That new king requires no advocacy as a knight. The simple
word “Agincourt” is sufficient. His wooing of Katherine of Valois
is also characteristic of the gallant, if not the amorous knight.
At the betrothal of the illustrious couple, Henry presented to the
lady his own favorite knight, Sir Louis de Robsart, as her personal
attendant, to watch for ever over her safety; but this queen’s
knight was simply the queen’s keeper, and his chief mission was
to take care that the lady was not stolen from him, between the
day of betrothal and that of the royal nuptials.</p>

<p>Although the reign of Henry V. formed a period of glory for
knighthood, the victories obtained by the chivalrous combatants
were effected at such a cost, that toward the close of the reign,
there were not men enough in England qualified to competently
carry on its civil business. It was still worse under Henry VI.
When peace with France was negotiating, the Cardinal of Winchester
represented to the French government that, during a
struggle of a quarter of a century, there had been more men, of
both countries, slain in these wars, for the title and claim to the
crown of France, than there were then existing in the two nations.
It was shocking, the Cardinal said, to think of so much Christian
blood having been shed;—and there were not very many Christian
knights left to cry “hear, hear,” to such an assertion.</p>

<p>Least cavalier of any of the kings who had hitherto reigned
was Henry VI., but there was chivalry enough for two in the
heart of his admirable wife, the most heroic, perhaps, of English
queens, Margaret of Anjou. How unlike was the destiny of this
ill-matched pair to that of their successors Edward IV. and his
wife Elizabeth Woodville! This king assumed one privilege of
knighthood, by loving whom he pleased, and marrying whom he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
loved. He was the first king of England who married with a
simple lady, that is, one not of princely blood. He did not
prosper much the more for it, for his reign was one of a rather
splendid misery, in which the luxurious king was faithful to no
one, neither to the friends who upheld his cause, nor to Mistress
Shore, who helped him to render his cause unworthy. Passing
over Edward V., we may notice that there was much more of the
knightly character in Richard III., than in the fourth Edward.
Richard would be better appreciated if we judged him according
to the spirit of the times in which he was born, and not by the
standard of our own. A braver monarch never fronted an English
force; and if heavy crimes can justly be laid to his account,
it should not be forgotten, that amid the bloody struggles which
he had to maintain, from the day almost of his accession, he had
leisure to put in force more than one enactment by which English
people profit, down even to the present period.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere remarked that many of us originally take our
idea of Henry VII. from the dashing Richmond who opens the
fifth act of Richard III. in panoply and high spirits. None of
Shakespeare’s characters make a more knight-like appearance
than he. The fact, nevertheless, is that Henry was anything but
chivalrous in mien or carriage. His mother was married, it was
said, when only nine years old; and it is added that Henry was
born in the year following the marriage. It is certain that the
lady was not in her teens, and to this circumstance, Turner is inclined
to attribute the feebleness of Henry’s constitution.</p>

<p>If he could not so well defend himself by the sword as poets
and Tudor historians have declared he could, he at least knew
how to do so by the strong arm of the law. It was in his reign
that benefit of clergy was taken from lay persons murdering their
lord, master, or sovereign immediate.</p>

<p>It is as certain that, in some parts of the island at least, the
chivalry of Richard, who was never nearly so black as he has
been painted, was more appreciated than the cautiousness of his
successful rival. In the northern counties, says Bacon, “the
memory of King Richard was so strong, that it lay like lees in
the bottom of men’s hearts, and if the vessel was but stirred, it
would come up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span></p>

<p>The <i>gallant</i> sentiment of chivalry was really strongly impressed
on the popular mind at this period. I may cite as an instance,
that not only was Perkin Warbeck, who may be called an adventurous
knight who has not had due justice rendered to him,
familiarly spoken of by the name of “the White Rose;” but that
if we may believe Bacon, the name was continued in common
speech to his wife, in compliment to her true beauty.</p>

<p>Henry has been much censured for a vice from which all knights
were bound, like friars, to be free. But there were chevaliers in
his reign who were as fond of money as he. Sir William Stanley
was one of them. At the period of his execution, there was found
in his castle of Holt, a more than modest temporary provision for
a poor knight. In ready money alone, there were forty thousand
marks—to say nothing of plate, jewelry, household furniture, and
live stock, all in abundance, and of the first quality. “And for
his revenue in land and fee, it was three thousand pounds sterling
a year of old rent, great matter in those times. The great spoil
of Bosworth field came almost wholly into this man’s hands, to his
infinite enriching.”</p>

<p>Bacon classes Henry VII., Louis XI., and Ferdinand of Aragon,
as the three <i>Magi</i> of kings of the age in which they lived.
It is a happy classification. Ferdinand, however, had more of the
knight in him than his royal cousins, and not less of the statesman.
He it was who first invented the resident embassador at foreign
courts.</p>

<p>In chivalric bearing, Henry VIII., when young, was perhaps
never equalled, and certainly never surpassed. He was the most
courteous of knights, and the most gallant of gentlemen. As long
as he had Cardinal Wolsey at his side to guide and control him,
he maintained this character unimpaired; and it was not till this
old Mentor died, that Henry lost his reputation as a Christian
knight and gentleman.</p>

<p>By a decree of the 24th of this king’s reign, no person below
the degree of a knight could wear a collar of SS. The judges
wear such collars because they are, or rank with, knights. That
a decree was issued to this effect would seem to imply that previous
to the period named, individuals below the knightly degree might
wear the collar in question. Edward IV., therefore, when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
conferred the collar on the Tanner of Tamworth, was not guilty
of any anomaly. On the contrary, he evidently knew what he
was about, by the remark—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“So here I <i>make</i> thee the best Esquire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That is in the North Countrie.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Edward’s time then, the collar may have constituted the difference
between squire and knight. But it was not the only one.
If there was a difference at their necks, there was also a distinction
at their heels. The knight always wore golden spurs: he was
the Eques Auratus. The squire could wear spurs of no more
costly metal than silver, and “White-spurs,” accordingly, was the
generic term for an esquire. It was probably in allusion to this
that the country squire mentioned by Jonson, displayed his silver
spurs among his side-board plate. To return to Henry VIII.;
let me add that he exhibited something of what was considered a
knightly attribute, compassion for the lowly, when he suggested
that due sleeping-time should be allowed to laborers during the
summer.</p>

<p>Edward VI. was simply a youth of much promise. His father
was unwilling to create him a knight before he knew how to wield
arms; and if he gained this knowledge early, he was never called
to put it in practice. There was more of the chivalrous character
in his over-abused half-sister, Mary, and also in Elizabeth; but
then queens can not of course be considered as knights: Elizabeth,
however, had much of the spirit, and she was surrounded by
knightly men and served with a knightly devotion. There was,
I may observe, one species of knights in her time, who were known
as “knights of the road.” The 39th of Elizabeth, especially and
curiously points to them in an act to relieve the hundred of Beynhurst
from the statute of Hue and Cry (where there was no voluntary
default) on account of the penalties to which that hundred
was subject from the numerous robberies committed in Maidenhead
Thicket. Mavor, in his account of Berkshire, says that “The
vicar of Henley who served the curé of Maidenhead, was allowed
about the same time an advance of salary as some compensation
for the danger of passing the thicket.” The vicar, like the knights
of the road, at least, had purer air than the clergy and chivalry who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
kept house in the capital. “In London,” says Euphues, “are all
things (as the fame goeth) that may either please the sight, or
dislike the smell; either fill the eye with delight, or fill the nose
with infection.”</p>

<p>Refreshment under such circumstances was doubly needed;
and the popular gratitude was due to that most serviceable of
knights, Sir Thomas Gresham, who introduced the orange as an
article of trade, and who was consequently painted by Antonio
More with an orange in his hand. The old Utrecht artist just
named, was knighted by Charles V. who paid him poorly—some
six hundred ducats for three pictures, but added knighthood, which
cost the emperor nothing, and was esteemed of great value by the
painter.</p>

<p>One would imagine that under Mary and Elizabeth, knighthood
had become extinguished, were we to judge by an anonymous
volume which was published in Mary’s reign, and republished in
that of Elizabeth. The great names of that period are proof to
the contrary, but there may have been exceptions. Let us then
look into the volume of this unknown writer who bewails the
degeneracy of his times, and lays down what he entitles the
“Institution of a Gentleman.”</p>
<hr class="full x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c22">“THE INSTITUTION OF A GENTLEMAN.”</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Your countenance, though it be glossed with knighthood, looks so borrowingly,
that the best words you give me are as dreadful as ‘stand and
deliver.’”—<i>The Asparagus Garden.</i></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> unknown author of the “Institution of a Gentleman,”
dedicates his able treatise to “Lorde Fitzwater, sonne and heire
to the Duke of Sussex.” In his dedicatory epistle he does not so
much mourn over a general decay of manners, as over the lamentable
fact, that the lowly-born are rising to gentility, while nobility
and knighthood are going to decay. These he beseeches “to build
gentry up again, which is, for truth sore decayed, and fallen to
great ruin, whereby such great corruption of manners hath taken
place, that almost the name of gentleman is quenched, and handicraftsmen
have obtained the title of honor, though (indeed) of
themselves they can challenge no greater worthiness than the
spade brought unto their late fathers.”</p>

<p>The writer is troubled with the same matter in his introductory
chapter. This chapter shows how, at this time, trade was taking
equality with gentry. “Yea, the merchantman thinketh not himself
well-bred unless he be called one of the worshipful sort of
merchants, of whom the handicraftsman hath taken example;
and taketh to be called ‘Master,’ whose father and grandfather
were wont to be called ‘Good Man.’”</p>

<p>On the question of “What is a gentleman?” the author goes
back to a very remote period, that of Adam, quoting the old
saying:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When Adam delved and Eve span,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who was then the gentleman?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and he makes the following comment upon this well-known text:</p>

<p>“There be many of so gross understanding that they think to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
confound a gentleman, when they ask of him this question. To
whom it may be said that so much grace as Adam our first father,
received of God at his creation, so much nobility and gentry he
received. And to understand perfectly how and after what demeanor
Adam behaved himself, or how he directed the order of
his life, the witnesses, I think, in that behalf are far to seek, whose
behavior, if it were good and honest, then was he the first gentleman,
even so much as the first earthly follower of virtues. But
if there were in him no such virtue, then was he the first gentleman
in whom virtues and gentle deeds did first appear.”</p>

<p>As a training toward excellence, our anonymous author recommends
severity of discipline from the cradle upward. “Neither,”
he says, “do I mean to allow <i>any</i> liberty to youth, for as liberty
is to all eyes hurtful, so is it to youth a present poison;” but he
forgets that even poisons are administered in small doses in order
to cure certain diseases, and that life would be a disease, even to
the young, without some measure of liberty. He is terribly afraid
that freedom in childhood will spoil the man, who himself will be
no man, with too much liberty, but a “Royster;” “and a ‘Royster,’”
he adds, “can not do the office of a gentleman, so long I
mean as a Roysterian he doth continue.”</p>

<p>He then informs us that there had long been in England a
division of classes, under the heads of “Gentle Gentle, Gentle
Ungentle, and Ungentle Gentle.” These were not classes of society
generally, but classes of the orders of Gentlemen exclusively.
The <i>Gentle Gentle</i> are those of noble birth, from dukes’ sons down
to esquires, provided they join to their “gentle house, gentle manners,
and noble conditions, which is the cause of the addition of
the other word called gentle.” This is much such a definition
of gentleman as might be now given, with the exception that the
question of birth has little to do with the matter, and that gentle
manners and noble conditions, as our author calls gentleman-like
bearing, scholarly education, and Christian principles, now make
of a man a gentleman, let him be of “gentle” house or not. Indeed,
the author himself is not indisposed to accept this method
of definition, for on proceeding to tell us what “Gentle Ungentle”
is, he says that “Gentle Ungentle is that man which is descended
of noble parentage, by the which he is commonly called gentle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
and hath in him such corrupt and ungentle manners as to the
judgment of all men he justly deserveth the name of ungentle.”
His remedy again for preventing the gentle becoming ungentle is
coercion in youth-time. He thinks that virtue is to be got from
the human being like oils or other juices from certain vegetable
substances, by ex-pression. Squeeze the human being tightly,
press him heavily, he is sure to yield something. No doubt; but
after the pressure he is often of little more use than a well-sucked
orange.</p>

<p>We next come to the “Ungentle Gentle.” In the definition of
this term, the author, with all his reverence for nobility, is compelled
to allow that there is a nobility of condition as well as a
nobility of birth; but others who contested this fact, gave a new
word to the English tongue, or made a new application of an old
word in order to support their theory and assail those whom they
sought to lower.</p>

<p>“Ungentle Gentle,” says our author, “is he which is born of a
low degree—which man, taking his beginning of a poor kindred,
by his virtue, wit, policy, industry, knowledge in laws, valiancy in
arms, or such like honest means, becometh a well-behaved and
high-esteemed man, preferred then to great office, put in great
charge and credit, even so much as he becometh a post or stay of
the commonwealth, and so growing rich, doth thereby advance and
set up the rest of his poor line or kindred. They are the children
of such one commonly called gentleman; of which sort of gentleman
we have now in England very many, whereby it should
appear that virtue flourisheth among us. These gentlemen are
now called ‘Up-starts,’ a term lately invented by such as pondered
not the grounds of honest means of rising or coming to promotion.”
Nevertheless, says our censor, there be upstarts enough
and to spare. The worshipful unworthies, he tells us, abound;
and the son of good-man Thomas, or good-man John, have obtained
the name of gentlemen, the degree of esquires or knights, and
possessing “a little dunghill forecast to get lands, by certain dark
augmentative practices,” they are called “worshipful” at every
assize. He dates the origin of this sort of nobility, knighthood
and esquirearchy, from the time of the suppression and confiscation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
of abbeys and abbey-estates. He has a curious passage on
this subject:—</p>

<p>“They have wrongfully intruded into gentry, and thrust themselves
therein, as Bayard, the cart-jade, might leap into the stable
of Bucephalus, and thrust his head into the manger with that worthy
courser. The particular names of whom, if I should go about
to rehearse, it would require long labor, and bring no fruit to the
readers thereof. And it is well known that such intruders, such
unworthy worshipful men, have chiefly flourished since the putting
down of abbeys, which time is within my remembrance.”</p>

<p>While allowing that gentlemanly manners help to make the gentleman,
and that birth is only an accidental matter, having little
to do with the subject, he still can not forbear to reverence rather
good men of high birth than good men of low degree. He evidently
thinks that he was enjoined by religion to do so, for he remarks:
“As in times past, no man was suffered to be ‘Knyght of the
Roodes,’ but such one as was descended of the lyne of gentleman,
whereby it appeareth that no men were thought so meet to defend
the right, that is to say the faith of Christ, as gentlemen,
and so to have their offices agreeable with their profession, it is
most meet that all gentlemen be called to such room and office as
may be profitable to the commonwealth.” This idea that the
holy sepulchre was to be rescued from the infidels only by gentlemen,
and the fact that it has not been so rescued, reminds me of
that king of Spain, who, finding himself in danger of being roasted
alive, from sitting in a chair which one of his great officers had
placed too near the fire, chose to roast on, for the singular reason
that there was no grandee at hand to draw his chair away again!</p>

<p>In 1555, this writer still accounted the profession of arms as
the noblest, the most profitable to the professor, and the most useful
to the commonwealth. Courage, liberality, and faithful observance
of all promises; thus endowed, he thinks a man is a true
gentleman. He draws, however, a happy parallel when admitting
that if it become a gentleman to be a good knight and valiant soldier,
it even more becometh him to be a great statesman. For,
“although to do valiantly in the wars it deserveth great praise
and recompense, yet to minister justice in the state of peace is an
office worthy of higher commendation. The reason is, wars are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
nothing necessary, but of necessity must be defended when they
fall. And contrariwise, peace is a thing not only most necessary,
but it is called the best thing which even nature hath given unto
man.” This parallel, if indeed it may be so called, is only employed,
however, for the purpose of showing that certain posts in
the state should only be given to gentlemen born. There is a
good deal of the red-tapist in our moralist after all; and he has a
horror, still entertained in certain localities, of admitting the democratic
element into the public offices. Thus we find him maintaining
that, “Unto a gentleman appertaineth more fully than unto
any other sort of man, embassage or message to be done between
kings or princes of this earth; more fitly I say, because gentlemen
do know how to bear countenance and comely gesture before
the majesty of a king, better than other sorts of men.” One
would think that the majesty of a king was something too dazzling
for a common man of common sense to look upon and live, and
yet the writer is evidently aware that there is nothing in it, for he
concludes his chapter on this matter by observing that “a gentleman
sent of embassage unto a prince ought to think a king to be
but a man, and, in reverence and humility, boldly to say his message
unto him.” Surely a man of good sense might do this, irrespective
of his birth, particularly at a time when the unskilfulness
and ignorance of gentlemen were so great as to pass into a proverb,
and “He shooteth like a gentleman fair and far off,” implied not
only ill-shooting with bows and arrows, “but it extended farther
and reached to greater matters, all to the dispraise of ignorant
gentlemen.”</p>

<p>It is so common a matter with us to refer to the days in which
this author wrote, as days in which old knights and country gentlemen
maintained such hospitality as has seldom been since witnessed,
that we are surprised to find complaint made, in this
treatise, of something just the contrary. The author enjoins these
knights and gentlemen to repair less to London, and be more seen
dispensing hospitality in their own houses. “In the ancient times,”
he says, “when curious buildings fed not the eye of the wayfaring
man, then might he be fed and have good repast at a gentleman’s
place, so called. Then stood the buttery door without a hatch;
yeoman then had no cause to carve small dishes; Flanders cooks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
had then no wages for their devices, nor square tables were not
used. This variety and change from the old English manner hath
smally enriched gentlemen, but much it hath impoverished their
names, not without just punishment of their inconsistency in that
behalf.” Let me add, that the writer thinks the country knight
or gentleman would do well were he to exercise the office of justice
of the peace. He is sorely afraid, however, that there is a disqualification,
on the ground of ignorance. A moralist might have
the same fear just now, without coming to the same conclusion.
Our author, for instance, argues that reverence is to be paid to the
noble, <i>quand même</i>. Let him be ignorant and tyrannical, yet to
reverence him is to give example of obedience to others. This
is very poor logic, and what follows is still worse; for this writer
very gravely remarks, that “We ought to bear the offences of
noble men patiently, and that if these forget themselves, yet ought
not smaller men to be oblivious of their duty in consequence, and
fail in their respect.”</p>

<p>We come upon another social trait, when we find the author
lamenting that, however much it becometh a gentleman to be acquainted
with hawking and hunting, yet that these pastimes are so
abused by being followed to excess, that “gentlemen will almost
do nothing else, or at the least can do that better than any other
thing.” To the excess alluded to does the author trace the fact
that “there are so many raw soldiers when time of war requireth
their help. This is the cause of so many unlearned gentlemen,
which, as some say, they understand not the inkhorn terms that
are lately crept into our language. And no marvel it is, though
they do not understand them, whereas in their own hawking and
hunting terms they be ignorants as ‘Auvent’ and ‘Retrouvre,’
which they call ‘<i>Houent</i>’ and ‘<i>Retrires</i>.’” What better could be
expected from men who had given up the practice of the long
bow to take to the throwing of dice? But there was now as wild
extravagance of dress as ignorance of uncommon things, in the
class of foolish knights and gentlemen. This is alluded to in the
chapter on dress, wherein it is said that “the sum of one hundred
pounds is not to be accounted in these days to be bestowed of apparel
for one gentleman, but in times past, a chamber gown was a
garment which dwelt with an esquire of England twenty years”—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
I believe that the knights were as frugal as the esquires.
“Then flourished the laudable simplicity of England,” exclaims
the author; “there were no conjurors and hot scholars, applying
our minds to learne our new trifle in wearing our apparel.” Upon
the point of fashions, the author writes with a feeling as if he
despaired of his country. “The Englishman,” he observes,
“changeth daily the fashion of his garment; sometimes he delighteth
in many guards, welts and pinks, and pounces. Sometimes
again, to the contrary, he weareth his garments as plain as a sack;
yet faileth he not to change also that plainness if any other new
fangle be invented. This is the vanity of his delight.” And this
vanity was common to all men of high degree in his time—to
those to whom “honor” was due, from men of less degree—and
these were “dukes, earls, lords, and such like, of high estate,” as
well as to those who were entitled to the “worship” of smaller
men, and <i>these</i> were “knights, esquires, and gentlemen.” There
is here, I think, some confusion in the way such terms are applied;
but I have not made the extract for the purpose of grounding a
comment upon it, but because it illustrates one portion of my subject,
and shows that while “your honor” was once the due phrase
of respect to the peerage, “your worship” was the reverential one
paid to knights, esquires, <i>and</i> gentlemen. We still apply the
terms, if not to the different degrees named above, yet quite as
confusedly, or as thoughtlessly with respect to the point whether
there be anything honorable or worshipful in the individual addressed.
This, however, is only a form lingering among the lower
classes. As matters of right, however, “his honor” still sits in
Chancery, and “your worship” is to be seen behind any justice’s
table.</p>

<p>We will now return to a race of kings who, whatever their defects,
certainly did not lack some of the attributes of chivalry.</p>

</div>

<p class="c less sp">THE STUARTS.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“May’t be pleasure to a reader’s ear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That never drew save his own country’s air,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To hear such things related.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent19"><span class="smcap">Heywood</span>, <i>the English Traveller</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">It</span> is an incontrovertible fact, that the king of England, who
least of all resembled a knight in his warlike character, was the
one who surpassed all his brother sovereigns in his knightly spirit
as a lover. I allude to James I. The godson of Charles IX. of
France was in his childhood, what his godfather had never been,
a dirty, droll boy. He is the only king who ever added an original
remark to a royal speech set down for him to deliver. The
remark in question was, probably, nearly as long as the speech,
for James was but four years old when he gave utterance to it.
He had been rolling about on the throne impishly watching, the
while, the grim lords to whom he, ultimately, recited a prepared
speech with great gravity and correctness. At the end of his
speech, he pointed to a split in the tiled roof of the hall, or to a
rent in the canopy of the throne, and announced to the lords and
others present the indisputable fact, that “there was a hole in the
parliament.”</p>

<p>The precocious lad passed no very melancholy boyhood in
Stirling Castle, till the Raid of Ruthven took him from his natural
protectors, and placed him in the hands of Gowrie. His escape
thence exhibited both boldness and judgment in a youth of
sixteen; and when Frederick II., of Denmark, gave him the
choice of the two Danish princesses for a wife, no one thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
that so gallant a king was undeserving of the compliment. When
it was, however, discovered that the royal Dane required James
either to accept a daughter or surrender the Orkney and Shetland
islands, as property illegally wrested from Denmark, men began
to look upon the Danish king as guilty of uncommonly sharp
practice toward the sovereign of the Scots. A world of trouble
ensued, which it is not my business to relate, although were I inclined
to be discursive—which, of course, I am <i>not</i>—I might
find great temptation to indulge therein, upon this very subject.
Suffice it then to say, that a world of trouble ensued before James
made his selection, and agreed to take, rather than prayed to have
granted to him, the hand of Elizabeth, the elder daughter of
Frederick II.</p>

<p>How the intrigues of Queen Elizabeth prevented this marriage
I must not pause to relate. The Danish Princess espoused a
reigning duke, and James was on the point of engaging himself
to Katherine of Navarre, when the offer of the hand of Anne the
younger daughter of Frederick being made to him, coupled with
the alternative of his either taking Anne, or losing the islands, he
“prayed and advised with God, for a fortnight,” and wisely resolved
to wed with “pretty Anne.”</p>

<p>The matter progressed anything but smoothly for a time. At
length, after endless vexations, the young princess was married by
proxy, in August, 1589, and set sail, soon after, for Scotland under
convoy of a dozen gallant ships, and with prospects of a very unpleasant
voyage.</p>

<p>A terrible storm blew bride and convoy on to the inhospitable
coast of Norway, and although two or three witches were executed
for raising this storm out of very spite, the matter was not
mended. Disaster pursued the fleet, and death overtook several
who sailed in it, till the coast of Scotland was fairly in sight.
The Scotch witches, or perhaps other causes not less powerful
than witches, in those seas, in the fall of the year, then blew the
fleet back to the mouth of the Baltic. “I was commissioned,”
said Peter Munch, the admiral, “to land the young queen in
Scotland; it is clear, therefore, that I can not return with her to
Denmark. I will put her majesty ashore, therefore, in Norway.”
The conclusion was not logically attained, but the fact was as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
have described it. Letters reached James announcing to him the
deplorable condition in which his queen was lying at Upslo, on
the Norwegian coast—storm-bound and half-famished. After
many projects considered for her relief, James resolved to set
forth and seek the princess himself. It is in this passage of his
life that we have an illustration of the degree in which he surpassed
all other kings who have sat on the English throne—as a
gallant knight <i>es amours</i>.</p>

<p>Toward the end of October, of this year, in the very stormiest
portion of the season, James went, privately, on board a diminutive
vessel, with a very reluctant party of followers and confederates,
leaving behind him, for the information of the astonished
lieges, a promise to be back in twenty days; and for their especial
profit, a solemn exhortation to live peaceably till he arrived again
among them, with his wife.</p>

<p>The knightly lover landed in Norway, early in November, and
made his way along the coast, now on foot, now on horseback
anon in sledges, and occasionally in boats or on shipboard, until
with infinite pains, and in a sorry plight, he reached Upslo, to no
one’s astonishment more than the queen’s, about the 19th of November.
Accoutred and travel-soiled as he was, he proceeded at
once to her presence. He was so well-pleased with the fair vision
before him, that he made as if he would at once kiss the queen,
who stood gazing at him. “It is not the form of my country,”
said pretty Anne, not very violently holding her head aside. “It’s
good old Scottish fashion,” said the young king: and it was observed
that in less than an hour, Anne had fallen very completely
into the pleasant mode from beyond seas, and quite forgotten the
forms of Denmark.</p>

<p>The young couple were duly married in person, on the Sunday
following the arrival of James. The latter, like any Paladin of
romance, had perilled life, and contended with almost insurmountable
obstacles, in order to win the royal lady after a less easy
fashion than marks the wooing and wedding of kings generally.
Such a couple deserved to have the merriest of marriage banquets,
but while such a storm was raging without as Norway itself had
never seen since the sea-wind first blew over her, such a tempest
was raised within, by the Scottish nobles, on a question of precedence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
that the king himself was chiefly occupied in soothing the
quarrellers, and only half succeeded in accomplishing the desired
end. Added to this was the prospect of a long winter among the
melancholy huts of Upslo. James, however, again exhibited the
spirit of a knight of more than ordinary gallantry. He not only
resolved that the young queen should not be thus imprisoned amid
the Norway snows till May, but he resolved to conduct her himself
across the Norwegian Alps, through Sweden, to her Danish
home. The idea of such a journey seemed to partake of insanity,
but James proceeded to realize it, by means of method and
judgment. He first performed the perilous journey alone, as far
as Sweden, and finding it practicable, returned for his wife, and
departed a second time, in her company. Much peril but small
accident accompanied them on their way, and when the wedding
party arrived safely at Cronenburg, toward the end of January,
the marriage ceremony was not only repeated for the third time—to
despite the witches who can do nothing against the luck that
is said to lie in odd numbers, but there was a succession of marriage
feasts, at which every gentleman drank deeper and deeper
every day, until such uproar and dissension ensued that few kept
their daggers in sheath except those who were too drunk to draw
them. That all were not in the more disgraceful state, or were
not continually in that condition, may be conjectured from the fact
that James paid a visit to Tycho Brahe, and conversed with the
astronomer in his observatory, in very vigorous Latin. The king,
however, was not sorry to leave old Denmark, and when a Scottish
fleet appeared off Cronenburg, to convey his bride and himself
homeward, he could no more be persuaded to stay a day
longer, than Tycho Brahe could be persuaded that Copernicus
was correct in dislodging the earth from its Ptolemaic stand-point
as centre of the solar system. The bridal party set sail on the
21st of April, 1590, and was safely moored in Leith harbor on
May-day. A pretty bride could not have arrived at a more appropriate
season. The royal knight and his lady deserved all the
happiness that could be awarded to the gallantry of the one and
the beauty of the other. But they did not escape the trials
common to much less dignified couples; and here the knightly
character of James may be said to terminate. Exemplary as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
had been as a lover, and faithful as he continued to be as a
husband, he was in all other respects, simply a shrewd man; and
not indeed always <i>that</i>. There is little of this quality in a
husband who begins and continues his married life with an indifference
upon the matter of borrowing. With James it was
silver spoons to-day, silk stockings to-morrow, and marks and
moidores from any one who would give him credit. The old
French knight who drank broth out of his own helmet rather
than sip it from a borrowed bowl, was moved at least by a good
principle. James rather agreed with Carlo Buffone, in Jonson’s
“Every Man out of his Humor,” that “it is an excellent policy to
owe much in these days.” A policy which, unfortunately, is
still deemed excellent, in spite of the ruin which attends its
practice.</p>

<p>The grave chivalry impressed on the face and features of Charles
I., is strikingly alluded to by Ben Jonson in his Masque of “The
Metamorphosed Gypsies;” for example:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“His brow, his eye, and ev’ry mark of state,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if he were the issue of each grace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bore about him <i>both his fame and fate</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Echard says of him, that he was perfect in all knightly exercises,
“vaulting, riding the great horse, running at the ring, shooting
with cross-bows, muskets, and sometimes great guns; that if
sovereignty had been the reward of excellences in those arts, he
would have acquired a new title to the crown, being accounted the
most celebrated marksman, and the most perfect manager of the
great horse, of any in the three kingdoms.”</p>

<p>It was with reference to the expression of the face, alluded to
by Jonson, that Bernini the sculptor said, on executing the bust
of Charles, that he had never seen any face which showed so much
greatness, and withal such marks of sadness and misfortune. The
knight, Sir Richard Bulstrode, tells us, that when the bust was
being carried across Greenwich Park, it suffered, what Moore
calls on another occasion, some “Tobit-like marks of patronage”
from the sparrows. “It was wiped off immediately,” says Charles’s
good knight—“but, notwithstanding all endeavors, it would not
be gotten off, but turned into blood.” No chevalier in poetic romance
meets with more threatening portent than the above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span></p>

<p>The Scotch soldiers of fortune, at this period, were as good representatives
as could be found of the old knight-errant. To them,
Vittorio Siri imputes many of the misfortunes of the period. Some
one tells of an old Scottish knight exclaiming, in a year of universal
peace, “Lord, turn the world upside-down, that gentlemen may
make bread of it.” So, for the sake of furthering their trade of
arms, the Scottish, and, indeed, other mercenary men-at-arms,
fanned the flame. The words of Siri are precise on this point, for
he says, “Le Leslie, le Gordoni, le Duglas ed altri milordi della
Scotia, del’ Inghilterra, e dell’ Irlanda.”</p>

<p>Never had knights of romance worse fare in the dungeons of
morose magicians than they who entered the bloody lists, where
was fought out the quarrel between royalty and republicanism.
“I heard a great officer say,” remarks Blount, “that during the
siege of Colchester, he dined at an entertainment, where the greatest
delicacies were roast horseflesh.”</p>

<p>The warlike spirit was, probably, never stronger than in this
reign. It is well illustrated by Hobbes, who remarks that, the
Londoners and citizens of other county capitals, who fought against
Charles, “had that in them which, in time of battle, is more conducing
to victory, than valor and experience both together; and
that was <i>spite</i>.”</p>

<p>But it is as a lover that Charles I. is chiefly distinguished when
we consider him solely to discover his knightly qualities. In his
early days he was strongly impressed by romance, and possessed
of romantic feelings. This fact is best illustrated by his conduct
in connection with the Spanish Match; and to this matter we will
devote a brief space, and go back to the time when James was
king, and Charles was Prince of Wales.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c24">THE SPANISH MATCH.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">This</span> unhappy and ill-advised affair, will ever remain one of the
darkest blemishes on the uniformly pacific but inglorious reign of
the royal pupil of Buchanan;—the whole detail is an ungrateful
one of intrigue and ill-faith, and however justly Buckingham may
be accused of exerting his baleful influence to dissolve the treaty,
and that he did so in the wantonness of his power is now past
doubt; the disgrace which should have attached to him, still hangs
round the memory of the timid king and his weak yet gallantly-disposed
son. I am more inclined to allow a high-mindedness of
feeling to Charles than to his father. The king, who supposed
the entire art of reigning lay in dissimulation, may not be charged
with an over-scrupulous nicety in his observations of the rules of
fair dealing; but the young prince, at this period, had the sentiments
without the vanity of a knight-errant, his only error was in
the constitutional weakness which bent to the arrogance of Buckingham’s
somewhat stronger mind. With such a disposition, the
favorite found it as easy to persuade Charles to break off the
match, as he had with facility advised him to the romantic journey—as
rash as it was impolitic. It would be almost an unprofitable
occupation to search for Buckingham’s motives, they are quite unattainable,
and, like hunting the hare in a wagon, conjecture
might lead us on, but we should, at every step, be farther from
our object. It is the received opinion, that the prince’s visit was
begun in caprice; and with caprice it ended. Buckingham viewed
it, perhaps, at first as a mere adventure, and he terminated it, because
his wounded pride suggested to him that <i>he</i> was not the
favorite actor in the piece. His terms were, “Ego et rex meus,”
and a less-distinguished station would not satisfy the haughty insolence
of Somerset’s succession in the precarious favor of the king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span></p>

<p>Our British Solomon who willed, but could not restore, the Palatinate
to his son-in-law, had long been accustomed to consider the
union of Charles with the Infanta, as the only available means left
by which he could secure the object he had so much at heart. He
was not made of the stern stuff, which in other kings would have
set a whole army in motion. That “sagacious simpleton” was
never in so turbulent a vein. His most powerful weapon was an
ambassador, and the best of these were but sad specimens of diplomacy,
and thus, weak as he was, both in the cabinet and field,
we may guess at his rapture when the marriage was agreed to by
the Court of Spain—the restoration of the Palatinate talked of as
a wedding present, and the bride’s dowry two millions of eight.</p>

<p>It was at the expiration of five years of negotiation, that James
at length saw the end of what had hitherto been an ever-continuing
vista. The dispensation of the Pope, an indispensable preliminary
to the union of a Most Catholic princess, with a Protestant heir-apparent,
had been held up as a difficulty; James immediately
loosened the reins with which he had held in the Catholic recusants—he
set them at liberty, for the good of the reformed religion, <i>he
said</i>; then apologized to his subjects for having so set them at
liberty—for the benefit of Protestantism; and finally, he exulted
in having accomplished so honorable an end for England, as making
her the first to enter the path of moderation. He, moreover, sent
to Spain, Digby, the good and great Lord Bristol, and while <i>he</i>
was negotiating with Philip IV., the Infanta’s brother, George
Gage, “a polite and prudent gentleman,” was employed at Rome
to smooth down the obstacles which the zeal of the Fourteenth
Gregory raised in behalf of his mother-church. The parties were
a long time at issue as to what period the presumed offspring of
this marriage should remain under the guardianship of their mother;
that is to say, under the Catholic tuition of her confessors.
The period of “fourteen years,” was suggested by the Pope, and
agreed to by the Court of Spain. Now, George Gage, we are
told, was both polite and prudent; George made some slight objection.
The father of the faithful and the descendant of Roderic
now named twelve years as the stipulated period of maternal or
ecclesiastical rule. Mr. Gage, without losing sight of his prudence,
retained all his civility; he treated the Pope courteously. Gregory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
in return, granted the dispensation, condescended even to agree
to the term of nine years, and merely asked a few privileges for
the Catholic suite of the Infanta, which were not hard to grant,
and would have been impolitic to refuse. James’s advisers counselled
him to demand the restitution of the Palatinate by a preliminary
treaty. This he wisely refrained from doing; he saw
that his desired object was considered inseparable from the marriage,
and he was content to trust to the existing treaty which,
probably, would not have been changed, had he so expressed his
wish. There is a curious item in all these diplomatic relations;
beside the public treaty there were various private articles, passed
between and signed by the parties concerned, agreeing that more
toleration should be granted to the papists, and that more of the
penal laws against them should be repealed than was expressed in
the public document. There appears also to have existed a yet
more private treaty, of even more restricted circulation, whereby
James was not to be required to act up to the very letter of that
article, by which his royal word pledged what was then considered—emancipation
to the Catholics.</p>

<p>Thus far had proceeded this tedious affair of state; the nation
was beginning to consider its accomplishment with diminished
aversion, and a few months would have brought a Spanish Princess
of Wales to England, when all this goodly and fair-wrought edifice
was destroyed by the temerity of the man who was the evil spirit
of the age. Charles’s youth and inexperience readily lent a willing
ear to the glowing description which Buckingham recounted
of the celebrated journey. His young melancholy was excited
into cheerfulness, when he dwelt on the hoped-for and surprised
rapture with which his destined bride would receive a prince
whose unusual gallantry spurned at the laws of political interest,
and whose chivalric feeling had broken through state negotiation,
and, despising to woo by treaty, had brought him to her feet to
win her by his merits. His blood warmed at the popularity he
would acquire by such a step, from a nation famed for its knightly
devotion to the fair, and whose watch-word, according to one of
its poets, has ever been, “love and the ladyes.” Charles would
have been a dull lover, indeed, had he only, like other princes,
thought his bride not worth the fetching. He would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
doubly dull and undeserving had he paused to consider the bearings,
the risks, or the probable absurdity of the act. There was
a certain political danger; but Charles, young, and a lover, refused
to see it; he was tearing the bonds which might bind more ignoble
princes, but were too weak to confine him; he rent the shackles
which proxies force on their principals, and stood in his own
princely strength to win a prize which has often lost the world.</p>

<p>The only step subsequent to the prince’s acquiescence, was to
obtain the king’s permission, a matter of little difficulty. They attacked
the good-natured and simple James at a moment when his
jovial humor would not have denied a greater boon. He had
sense, however, to see something of the impropriety of the absence
of Charles and Buckingham from England; but his obtusity of
intellect was overpowered by the craft of his favorite, and the petitioners
at length obtained his unadvised sanction to the wild enterprise,
less by the strength of their arguments, than the persisting
urgency of its expression. The prince and his companion
further obtained a promise of secrecy; and they saw nothing more
wanting than the ordinary preparations for their departure. Left
to his own reflections, however, the poor king reproached his own
weakness; he saw with terror that his subjects would not readily
forgive him for committing so invaluable a pledge into the hands
of a Catholic sovereign, who might detain Charles in order to enforce
new exactions or demands; and with equal terror he saw
that even success could not possibly justify the means; for there
was no advantage to be obtained, and no unprejudiced censurer
would consider the freak otherwise than as one played for the
gratification of the will of the duke, and of an enthusiastic prince,
whose abstract idea of chivalrous love had overcome his character
for prudence.</p>

<p>There ensued, on the return of Charles and Buckingham to the
royal presence for despatches, a melancholy scene. There were the
objurgations and schoolboy blubbering of the monarch, the insolent
imperiousness of the favorite, and the silent tears and submission
of the prince. The audacious threats of the duke wrung from
James the assent which Buckingham required—a second permission
for their journey. A knight, Sir Francis Cottington, the
prince’s secretary, and Endymion Porter, a gentleman of the bedchamber,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
were selected as the attendants of the Prince. The duke
was, however, also to be accompanied by his master of the horse,
a man of knight’s degree, Sir Richard Graham. There was a
recapitulation of the crying scene when the two former gentlemen
were appointed, for Sir Francis boldly pointed out the danger of
the proceeding. Charles’s countenance showed his displeasure;
but Buckingham was completely carried away by his overwhelming
passion. James cried, the duke swore, and the king had nothing
left to do, but to wish them God speed on their amorous and
knight-errant mission.</p>

<p>There is a work, known to many and read by few, the “Epistolæ
Howelianæ,” consisting of a collection of familiar letters on
many subjects, by a certain James Howell. The author was a
cadet of a noble family, several members of which had been on
the roll of knighthood. He pushed his fortunes with all the
vigor of an aspiring younger brother. His letters exhibit him as
agent to a glass factory at Vienna—a tutor—a companion—a
clerk—secretary to an embassy—agent again, and finally an attaché
to the privy council. Master Howell, in these epistles, continually
rings the changes on the importance of attending to the
main chance; bewails the stagnation which non-employment throws
round his fortunes; or congratulates himself on the progress they
are making, through his industry. At the period of Charles’s
visit to Madrid, he was agent there for the recovery of a vessel
taken by unlawful seizure, and he contemplates the prince’s arrival
with delight, viewing him as a powerful adjunct to his cause.
He complains bitterly of the prince as showing more condescension
to the needy Spanish poor, than politeness to the accredited agent
of an English company. The agent’s honor or ruin depended on
the success of his mission, hence good Master Howell is occasionally
and ill at ease. The success of his mission, too, hung upon
the happy termination of the match; a marriage he considers as
the avant-courier of his appointments, but should some unlucky reverse
prevent the end he hopes for, why then, to use one of the
worshipful agent’s most favorite figures of speech—then “my
cake is dough.” His letters are the chief authority for what follows.</p>

<p>It is quite consistent with the whole character of this drama,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
that the journey should be prosecuted through France. Charles
and his suite travelled incognito it is true, but Buckingham was
rash enough to introduce the prince at a court-ball in Paris, where
he perhaps saw and admired the lovely Henrietta Maria. From
the gay court of France the errant company speedily decamped,
hurried rapidly toward the south, and crossed the frontier just in
time to escape the strong arm of the governor of Bayonne, stretched
out to arrest their progress.</p>

<p>On Friday the 7th of March, 1623, Charles and his attendants
arrived at Madrid, under the guise of very homely personages.
Buckingham took a name which has since served to cover a fugitive
king of the French—that of (Thomas) Smith, and therewith
he entered Bristol’s mansion, “’twixt the gloaming and the murk,”
with a portmanteau under his arm, while Charles waited on the
other side of the street, not as the Prince of Wales, but as Thomas
Smith’s brother, John. Lord Bristol did not allow the son of his
monarch to remain long in such a situation. Charles was conducted
to the house, and on being ushered into a bedchamber, he
immediately asked for writing materials, and despatched a messenger
to his father, announcing his safe arrival in the Spanish
capital. Cottington and Porter arrived the next day; and even
so soon as this, a report was spreading through the city that James
himself was in Madrid. On the evening of Saturday, Buckingham
went privately to court, in his own person, and told the tale
of the adventures of the knight to whom he had acted as squire.
The delight of all parties was intense. Olivarez accompanied
Buckingham on his return to the prince, to express how immeasurably
glad his Catholic majesty was at his coming. This proud
minister, who was the contemporary, and perhaps the equal, of
Richelieu, knelt and kissed the prince’s hand, and “hugged his
thighs,” says Mr. Howell, like a slave as he was. Gondomar,
too, hastened to offer his respects and congratulations to the young
prince. At ten that night, too, came the most distinguished as he
was the most desired visiter: Philip himself appeared in generous
haste to welcome the person and thank the noble confidence of his
almost brother-in-law. The meeting of the parties appears to
have been unaffected and cordial. After the salutations and divers
embraces which passed in the first interview, <i>they parted late</i>. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
stern severity of Spanish etiquette would not permit of Charles’s
introduction to the Infanta, and it was accordingly arranged that
the princess should appear in public on Sunday, and the prince
meet her on the Prado, just as the knight Guzman sees Inez, in
the ancient ballad. In the afternoon of the eventful day, the
whole court, neglecting for the occasion all sumptuary laws, appeared
in all its bravery. Philip, his queen, two brothers, and
the Infanta, were together in one carriage, and the princess, the
cynosure of attraction, scarcely needed the blue riband which encircled
her arm, as a sign by which Charles might distinguish her.
The knightly lover, who had experienced some difficulty in making
his way through the exulting multitude, who threw up their caps
and cried “God bless him,” was in waiting, with his diminutive
court and Count Gondomar, to view the defiling of the procession.
The royal carriage approached, and as the eyes of the princess
first rested on her destined lord, she blushed deeply, “which,”
adds the calculating Mr. Howell, “we hold to be an impression
of love and affection, for the face is oftentimes a true index of the
heart.” The Infanta, at this period, was only sixteen and tall for
her age—“a very comely lady,” says the agent, “rather of a
Flemish complexion than Spanish, fair-haired, and carried a most
pure mixture of red and white in her face: she is full and big-lipped,
which is held as beauty rather than a blemish.”</p>

<p>Charles was now honored with a complete court establishment
and apartments in the palace; there was revelry in camp and city;
and the gallantry of the journey so touched this high-minded
people, that they declared the beautiful bride ought to have been
made Charles’s immediate reward. Gayety was at every heart
and poesy, in the person of Lope de Vega, celebrated “the Stuart,”
and “Marie, his star.” In all the festivals and carousals at court,
Charles was not once permitted to approach “his star.” The
royal family sat together under a canopy, but there was ever some
unwelcome intervener between the lovers, and the prince was
compelled to satisfy his ardent soul with gazing. The worthy
English agent records that he has seen him “have his eyes immovably
fixed upon the Infanta half-an-hour together, in a thoughtful,
speculative posture, which,” he sagaciously adds, “would needs
be tedious unless affection did sweeten it.” It was on one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
these occasions that Olivarez, with less poetic truth than energy
of expression, said that Charles watched her <i>as a cat does a
mouse</i>.</p>

<p>Whatever outward respect Charles may have voluntarily offered
to the prejudices and observances of Spanish ceremony, he, and
perhaps the blushing Infanta, thought it very cumbersome love-work
for young hearts. Words had passed between them, it is
true, but only through the medium of an interpreter, and always
in the presence of the king, for Philip “sat hard by, to overhear
all,” and understand if he could, the interpretations made by Lord
Bristol.</p>

<p>Weary of this restraint, the prince soon found means, or rather
an opportunity, to break through the pompous obstacles which
opposed the good old plan of love-making, and he, with Endymion
Porter to attend him, did not fail to profit by the occasion. Near
the city, but across the river, the king had a summer-house, called
Casa di Campo. Charles discovered that the Infanta was accustomed
to go very often of a morning to gather May-dew. The
knight and esquire, accordingly, donning a silken suit for a spring
morning, went out betimes, and arrived without let or hindrance
at the Casa di Campo. Their quality was a sure passport, and
doors, immovably closed to all others, opened to <i>them</i>. They
passed through the house into the garden, but to their wonder and
disappointment, the “light of love” was not visible. The Infanta
had not arrived, or had fled, and disappointment seemed likely to
be the probable reward of their labor. The garden was divided
from an adjoining orchard by a high wall; the prince heard voices
on the other side, perhaps heard <i>the</i> voice, and hastened to a
door which formed the only communication of the two divisions.
To try this outlet was the work of a moment; to find it most vexatiously
locked, was the conviction of the next. The lover was
at bay, and Endymion’s confused brain had no resource to suggest.
They looked at the wall. It was high, undoubtedly; but was
ever such a barrier too high for a king’s son—a knight and a
gallant, when it stood between him and such a “star” as the muse
of De Vega made of the Infanta? Charles was on the summit
of the wall almost as soon as the thought of climbing it had first
struck him; with the same eagerness he sprang lightly down on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
the other side, and hastily made toward the object of his temerity.
Unfortunately there was an old “duenna” of a marquis with her
in quality of guardian, and the Infanta, who perchance expected
to see the intruder, was constrained, for the sake of appearances,
to scream with well-dissembled terror. “She gave a shriek and
ran back.” Charles followed, but the grim marquis interfered his
unwelcome person between the lovers. “Turning to the prince,
he fell on his knees, conjuring his highness to retire;” he swore
by his head, that if he admitted the prince to the company of the
Infanta, he, the grisly guardian of the dove, might pay for it with
his head. As the lady, meanwhile, had fled, and did not return,
Charles was not obdurate. Maria, though she had escaped (because
seen) could not but be pleased with the proof he had given
of his devotion, and as the old marquis continued to talk of his
head, the prince, whose business lay more with the heart, turned
round and walked slowly away. He advanced toward the door,
the portal was thrown open, and thus, as Mr. Howell pithily says,
“he came out under that wall over which he had got in.” Endymion
was waiting for him, and perhaps for his story, but the knight
was sad, and his squire solemn. Charles looked an embodying
of the idea of gloom, and Master Porter, with some ill-will, was
compelled to observe a respectful silence.</p>

<p>The Infanta and her governor hurried back to the palace, while
her suitor and his followers were left to rail in their thoughts
against the caprice of the ladies, and the reserve of royal masters;
and so ends a pretty story of “how a princess went to gather
May-dew.”</p>

<p>This solitary and unsuccessful love-passage was the last effort
which Charles made to engage the good-will of Maria. He, at
once, retired to his apartments in the palace; whence he seldom
went abroad, except for the purpose of attending a bull-fight.
Buckingham was sick a-bed, his offended nobility lay ill-disposed
at court, and the palace residence was gradually becoming irksome
to all parties. Charles could only have bedchamber prayers, and
not possessing a room where he might have attended the service
of his own church, the sacred plate and vestments he had brought
over were never used. Moreover, the Knights of the Garter,
Lords Carlisle and Denbigh, had well nigh set the palace on fire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
through leaving their lighted pipes in a summer-house. The
threatened mischief, however, was prevented by the activity of
Master Davies, my Lord of Carlisle’s barber, who “leapt down a
great height and quenched it.” Perhaps a more unfortunate accident
than this, in the eyes of a Catholic population, was a brawl
within the royal precinct between Ballard, an English priest, and
an English knight, Sir Edmund Varney. The prince had a page
named Washington, lying mortally ill; to save his soul the anxious
priest hastened to the death-bed of the page; here, however,
he met Sir Edmund, an unflinching pillar of the English church.
An unseemly scene ensued; and while knight and priest passed
from words to blows, the poor suffering page silently died, and
soon after was consigned to the earth under a fig-tree in Lord
Bristol’s Garden.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Princess Infanta was publicly addressed
as Princess of Wales, and as an acquaintance with the English
language was a possession much to be desired by the bearer of so
proud a title, the Lady Maria began “<i>her accidence</i>,” and turned
her mind to harsh declensions and barbarous conjugations.
Though enthusiasm had somewhat cooled, the business continued
to proceed; the most serious interruption was occasioned by the
death of the Pontiff, as it entailed many of the ensuing obstacles
which at once began to rise. The unfinished work of Gregory
was thought to require a <i>da capo</i> movement from his successor
Urban, and the new Hierarch commenced a string of objections
and proposals, which were of no other effect than to produce mistrust
and delay. Buckingham too, recovering from his sickness,
longed to return to England, where it was now understood that
the Pope’s tardiness was founded on hopes of the prince’s conversion.
The people of England were alarmed and clamorous.
Charles and the duke discontented and impatient. The latter
urged a return, and the prince, in expressing his wishes to Philip,
stated as his reasons, his father’s age and infirmities, the murmurs
of his people, and the fact that a fleet was at sea to meet him.
He added, a most close argument, that the articles which had been
signed in England bore, as a proviso, that if he did not return
by a specified month, they should be of no validity. It honorably
belied the suspicions against the Spanish Cabinet, that not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
the slightest opposition was made to the return; proxies were
named, and on the termination of affairs with the Pope, Maria
was to follow Charles to England. The lady is said to have remarked,
that if she was not worth waiting for she was not worth
having. Charles must have felt the remark, but the duke was
paramount, and the wind, which favored their departure, as speedily
blew away the popularity of a prince whose knightly bearing,
modest gallantry, and high virtues, so particularly formed him for
the favorite of a romantic nation. The treaty for the Spanish
match was broken.</p>

<p>The secret history of the French match possesses an equal interest
with that of the Spanish; but Charles only wrote to his
bride on this occasion, and met her, on her way to him, at Canterbury.</p>

<p>As a further instance of the chivalrous gallantry of Charles I.,
it deserves to be recorded, that he it was who suggested a revival
of the custom of inviting the ladies to participate in the honors
of the Garter. I have elsewhere said, that at one time, the
ladies were regularly admitted, but nothing is known as to when
this gallant custom was first introduced. Dr. Barrington, in his
excellent “Lectures on Heraldry,” says, that “in the earliest notice
of the habit of the order having been issued to the ladies, immediately
after the accession of Richard II.,” they are said to
have been “newly received into the Society of the Garter,” and
were afterward called “Ladies of the Fraternity of St. George.”
Who were admitted to this distinguished order, or how long the
practice continued, does not appear, though it is probable it had
fallen into disuse in the time of Henry VIII. Charles remained
content with merely suggesting the revival of the custom, and
“nothing,” says Dr. Barrington, “seems to have been done to carry
this suggestion into effect. If any one period,”—adds the
doctor, most appropriately—“if any one period were more fit
than another for doing it, it must surely be the present, when a
<i>lady</i> is the sovereign of the order.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c25">THE KINGS OF ENGLAND AS KNIGHTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c less sp">FROM STUART TO BRUNSWICK.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">Charles</span> II. loved the paraphernalia of courts and chivalry.
He even designed to create two new orders of knighthood—namely
“the Knights of the Sea,” a naval order for the encouragement
of the sea-service; and “the Knights of the Royal Oak,”
in memory of his deliverance, and for the reward of civil merit.
He never went much farther than the intention. He adopted the
first idea at another’s suggestion, and straightway thought no more
of it. The second originated with himself, and a list of persons
was made out, on which figured the names of the intended knights.
The matter never went further.</p>

<p>At Charles’s coronation, the knights of the Bath were peculiarly
distinguished for their splendor. They were almost too gorgeously
attired to serve as waiters, and carry up, as they did the
first course to the king’s own table, at the coronation banquet,
after a knight of the Garter had been to the kitchen and had eaten
a bit of the first dish that was to be placed before his Sacred
Majesty.</p>

<p>If the king was fond of show, some at least of his knights,
shared in the same feeling of vanity. The robes in recent times
were worn only on occasions of ceremony and service. The king
revived a fashion which his knights followed, and which sober
people (who were not knights) called a ridiculous humor.
They were “so proud of their coats,” as the expression went,
that they not only wore them at home, but went about in them,
and even rode about the park with them on. Mr. Pepys is particularly
indignant on this matter especially so, when told that
the Duke of Monmouth and Lord Oxford were seen, “in a hackney-coach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
with two footmen in the park with their robes on; which,”
adds the censor, “is a most scandalous thing, so as all gravity may
be said to be lost, among us.” There was more danger of what
Pepys calls “gravity” being lost, when the Order, at command
of the Sovereign head, elected such men as the Elector of Saxony,
who had no other distinction but that of being a good drinker.</p>

<p>I do not know what the rule now may be in St. George’s
Chapel, but in the reign of Charles II., a singular regulation is
noticed by Pepys. He went in good company to the royal chapel,
where he was placed, by Dr. Childe, the organist, “among the
knights’ stalls, and pretty the observation,” he adds, “that no man,
but a woman, may sit in a knight’s place, where any brass plates
are set.” What follows is also, in some degree, germane to our
purpose. “Hither come cushions to us, and a young singing boy
to bring us a copy of the anthem to be sung. And here, for our
sakes, had this anthem and the great service sung extraordinary,
only to entertain us. Great bowing by all the people, the poor
knights particularly, toward the altar.”</p>

<p>Charles II. was the first monarch who allowed the Knights of
the Garter to wear, as at present, the star of the order on the
breast of the coat. Our present queen has renewed in her gracious
person, the custom that was once observed, if we may believe
Ashmole, by the ladies, that is, the wives of Knights of the Garter—namely,
of wearing the symbol of the order as a jewelled badge,
or a bracelet, on the arm. This is in better taste than the mode
adopted by Lady Castlereagh, at the gay doings attendant upon
the sitting of the Congress of Vienna; where the noble lady in
question appeared at court with her husband’s jewelled garter, as
a bandeau, round her forehead!</p>

<p>James II. has had not merely his apologists but his defenders.
He had far more of the knightly character than is commonly supposed.
For a long time he labored under the disadvantage of
being represented, in England, by historians only of the Orange
faction. Poor Richard the Third has suffered by a similar misfortune.
He was wicked enough, but he was not the monster described
by the Tudor historians and dramatists.</p>

<p>James, in his youth, had as daring and as crafty a spirit as ever
distinguished the most audacious of pages. The tact by the employment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
of which he successfully made his escape from the republican
guards who kept him imprisoned at St. James’s, would
alone be sufficient proof of this. When Duke of York, he had the
compliment paid to him by Condé, that if ever there was a man
without fear it was he. Under Turenne he earned a reputation
of which any knight might be proud; and in the service of Spain,
he won praise for courage, from leaders whose bravery was a theme
for eulogy in every mouth.</p>

<p>Partisans, not of his own faction, have censured his going publicly
to mass soon after his accession; but it must be remembered
that the Knights of the Garter, in the collar of their order, complacently
accompanied him, and that the Duke of Norfolk was the
only knight who left him at the door of the chapel.</p>

<p>He had little of the knight in him in his method of love, if one
may so speak. He cared little for beauty; so little, that his brother
Charles remarked that he believed James selected his mistresses
by way of penance. He was coarsely minded, and neither practised
fidelity nor expected it in others. Whatever he may have
been in battle, there was little of the refinement of chivalry about
him in the bower. It was said of Louis XIV. and his successor,
that if they were outrageously unfaithful to their consorts, they
never failed to treat them with the greatest politeness. James
lacked even this little remnant of chivalrous feeling; and he was
barely courteous to his consort till adversity taught him the worth
of Mary of Modena.</p>

<p>He was arrogant in prosperity, but the slightest check dreadfully
depressed him, and it is hardly necessary to say that he who
is easily elated or easily depressed, has little in him of the hero.
His conduct when his throne was menaced was that of a poor craven.
It had not about it the dignity of even a decent submission.
He rose again, however, to the heroic when he attempted to recover
his kingdom, and took the field for that purpose. This conduct
has been alluded to by a zealous and impartial writer in the “Gentleman’s
Magazine,” for November, 1855. “After the battle of
the Boyne,” he says, “the Orange party circulated the story that
James had acted in the most cowardly manner, and fled from the
field before the issue was decided. Not only was this, in a very
short time believed, but even sensible historians adopted it, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
came down to us as an historical fact. Now in the secret archives
of France there are several letters which passed between Queen
Mary and the Earl of Tyrconnel, and these together with some of
the secret papers, dispose at once of the whole story. It has now
been placed beyond a doubt, that the king was forced from the
field. Even when the day was lost and the Dutch veterans had
routed the half-armed and undisciplined Irish, James rallied a part
of the French troops, and was leading them on, when Tyrconnel
and Lauzun interposed, pointed out the madness of the attempt,
and seizing the reins of his horse, compelled him to retreat.”</p>

<p>This is perhaps proving a little too much, for if the day was
lost, it was not bravery, but rashness, that sought to regain it; and
it is the first merit of a knight, the great merit of a general, to discern
when blood may be spilled to advantage. As for the archives
in France, one would like to know upon what authority the papers
preserved there make their assertions. Documents are exceedingly
valuable to historians, but they are not always trustworthy.
The archives of France may contain Canrobert’s letter explaining
how he was compelled to put constraint upon the bravery of Prince
Napoleon, and send him home, in consequence of severe indisposition.
And yet the popular voice has since applied a very uncomplimentary
surname to the Prince—quite as severe, but not so
unsavory, as that which the people of Drogheda still apply to
James. In either case there is considerable uncertainty. I am
inclined to believe the best of both of these illustrious personages,
but seeing that the uncertainty is great, I am not sure that Scarron
was wrong when he said that the best way of writing history was
by writing epigrams, pointed so as to prick everybody.</p>

<p>Cottington (Stafford’s Letters) tells us of a domestic trouble in
which James was concerned with one of his knights. The king’s
perplexities about religion began early. “The nurse is a Roman
Catholic, to whom Sir John Tunston offered the oath of allegiance,
and she refused it; whereupon there grew a great noise both in
the town and court; and the queen afflicted herself with extreme
passion upon knowledge of a resolution to change the woman. Yet
after much tampering with the nurse to convert her, she was let
alone, to quiet the queen.” The dissension is said to have so
troubled the nurse, as also to have injured the child, and never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
had knight or king more difficult task than James, in his desire to
please all parties.</p>

<p>It was one of the characteristics of a knight to bear adversity
without repining; and if Dodd may be believed, James II. was
distinguished for this great moral courage in his adversity. The
passage in Dodd’s Church History is worth extracting, though
somewhat long: “James was never once heard to repine at his
misfortune. He willingly heard read the scurrilous pamphlets
that were daily published in England against him. If at any time
he showed himself touched, it was to hear of the misfortunes of
those gentlemen who suffered on his account. He would often
entertain those about him with the disorders of his youth, but it
was with a public detestation of them, and an admonition to others
not to follow his example. The very newspapers were to him a
lesson of morality; and the daily occurrences, both in the field and
the cabinet, were looked upon by him, not as the result of second
causes, but as providential measures to chastise both nations and
private persons, according to their deserts. He would sometimes
say that the exalted state of a king was attended with this great
misfortune, that he lived out of the reach of reproof, and mentioned
himself as an example. He read daily a chapter in the Bible,
and another in that excellent book, ‘The Following of Christ.’ In
his last illness he publicly forgave all his enemies, and several of
them by name, especially the Prince of Orange, whom he acknowledged
to be his greatest friend, as being the person whom Providence
had made use of to scourge him and humble him in the
manner he had done, in order to save his soul.” As something
very nearly approaching to reality, this is more pleasing than the
details of dying knights in romance, who after hacking at one another
for an hour, mutually compliment each other’s courage, and
die in the happiest frame of mind possible. Some one speaking
of this king, and of Innocent II., made an apt remark, worth the
quoting; namely, that “he wished for the peace of mankind that
the pope had turned papist, and the king of England, protestant!”
How far the latter was from this desired consummation is wittily
expressed in the epitaph on James, made by one of the poet-chevaliers,
or, as some say, by one of the abbés who used to lounge
about the terrace of St. Germains.</p>

<p>I have noticed, in a previous page, the very scant courtesy
which the queen of Charles I. met with at the hands of a Commonwealth
admiral. The courtesy of some of the Stuart knights
toward royal ladies was not, however, of a much more gallant
aspect. I will illustrate this by an anecdote told by M. Macaulay
in the fourth volume of his history. The spirit of the Jacobites
in William’s reign had been excited by the news of the fall of
Mons.... “In the parks the malcontents wore their biggest
looks, and talked sedition in their loudest tones. The most conspicuous
among these swaggerers was Sir John Fenwick, who
had in the late reign been high in favor and military command,
and was now an indefatigable agitator and conspirator. In his
exaltation he forgot the courtesy which man owes to woman.
He had more than once made himself conspicuous by his impertinence
to the queen. He now ostentatiously put himself in her
way when she took her airing, and while all around him uncovered
and bowed low, gave her a rude stare, and cocked his hat in
her face. The affront was not only brutal but cowardly. For
the law had provided no punishment for mere impertinence, however
gross; and the king was the only gentleman and soldier in
the kingdom who
could not protect his wife from contumely with his sword. All
that the queen could do was to order the park-keepers not to
admit Sir John again within the gates. But long after her death
a day came when he had reason to wish that he had restrained
his insolence. He found, by terrible proof, that of all the Jacobites,
the most desperate assassins not excepted, he was the only
one for whom William felt an intense personal aversion.”</p>

<p>The portrait of William III. as drawn by Burnet, does not
wear any very strong resemblance to a hero. The “Roman nose
and bright sparkling eyes,” are the most striking features, but the
“countenance composed of gravity and authority,” has more of
the magistrate than the man at arms. Nevertheless, and in
despite of his being always asthmatical, with lungs oppressed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
the dregs of small-pox, and the slow and “disgusting dryness”
of his speech, there was something chivalrous in the character of
William. In “the day of battle he was all fire, though without
passion; he was then everywhere, and looked to everything.
His genius,” says Burnet in another paragraph, “lay chiefly in
war, in which his courage was more admired than his conduct.
Great errors were often committed by him; but his heroical
courage set things right, as it inflamed those who were about
him.” In connection with this part of his character may be
noticed the fact that he procured a parliamentary sanction for the
establishment of a standing army. His character, in other respects,
is not badly illustrated by a remark which he made, when
Prince of Orange, to Sir W. Temple, touching Charles II.
“Was ever anything so hot and so cold as this court of yours?
Will the king, who is so often at sea, never learn the word that I
shall never forget, since my last passage, when in a great storm
the captain was crying out to the man at the helm, all night,
‘Steady, steady, steady!’” He was the first of our kings who
would not touch for the evil. He would leave the working of all
miracles, he said, to God alone. The half-chivalrous, half-religious,
custom of washing the feet of the poor on Maundy
Thursday, was also discontinued by this prince, the last of the
heroic five Princes of Orange.</p>

<p>Great as William was in battle, he perhaps never exhibited
more of the true quality of bravery than when on his voyage to
Holland in 1691, he left the fleet, commanded by Sir Cloudesley
Shovel and Sir George Rooke, and in the midst of a thick fog
attempted, with some noblemen of his retinue, to land in an open
boat. “The danger,” says Mr. Macaulay, who may be said to have
<i>painted</i> the incident in a few words, “proved more serious than
they had expected.” It had been supposed that in an hour the
party would be on shore. But great masses of floating ice impeded
the progress of the skiff; the night came on, the fog grew
thicker, the waves broke over the king and the courtiers. Once
the keel struck on a sandbank, and was with great difficulty got
off. The hardiest mariners showed some signs of uneasiness, but
William through the whole night was as composed as if he had
been in the drawing-room at Kensington. “For shame,” he said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
to one of the dismayed sailors, “are you afraid to die in my
company?” The <i>vehis Cæsarem</i> was, certainly, not finer than
this.</p>

<p>The consort of Queen Anne was of a less chivalrous spirit
than William. Coxe says of him, that even in the battle-field he
did not forget the dinner-hour, and he appears to have had more
stomach for feeding than fighting. Of George I., the best that
can be said of him in his knightly capacity, has been said of
him, by Smollet, in the remark, that this prince was a circumspect
general. He did not, however, lack either courage or impetuosity.
He may have learned circumspection under William of Orange.
Courage was the common possession of all the Brunswick princes.
Of some of them, it formed the solitary virtue. But of George
I., whom it was the fashion of poets, aspiring to the laureatship,
to call the great, it can not be said, as was remarked of Philip
IV. of Spain, when he <i>took</i> the title of “Great,” “He has become
great, as a ditch becomes great, by losing the land which
belonged to it.”</p>

<p>One more custom of chivalry observed in this reign, went
finally out in that of George II. I allude to the custom of giving
hostages. According to the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, “two
persons of rank were to reside in France, in that capacity, as
sureties to France that Great Britain should restore certain of its
conquests in America and the West Indies.” The “Chevalier,”
Prince Charles Edward, accounted this as a great indignity to
England, and one which, <i>he said</i>, he would not have suffered if
he had been in possession of his rights.</p>

<p>The age of chivalry, in the old-fashioned sense of the word,
went out before Burke pronounced it as having departed. I do
not think it survived till the reign of George II. In that reign
chivalry was defunct, but there was an exclusive class, whose
numbers arrogated to themselves that nice sense of honor which
was supposed, in olden times, to have especially distinguished the
knight. The people alluded to were <i>par excellence</i>, the people of
“fashion.” The gentlemen who guarded, or who were supposed
to guard, the brightest principle of chivalry, were self-styled
rather than universally acknowledged, “men of honor.”</p>

<p>The man of honor has been painted by “one of themselves.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
The Earl of Chesterfield spoke with <i>connoissance de fait</i>, when
he treated of the theme; and his lordship, whose complacency on
this occasion, does not permit him to see that his wit is pointed
against himself, tells a story without the slightest recollection of
the pithy saying of the old bard, “De te fabula narratur.”</p>

<p>“A man of honor,” says Lord Chesterfield, “is one who peremptorily
affirms himself to be so, and who will cut anybody’s
throat that questions it, even upon the best grounds. He is infinitely
above the restraints which the laws of God or man lay
upon vulgar minds, and knows no other ties but those of honor,
of which word he is to be the sole expounder. He must strictly
advocate a party denomination, though he may be utterly regardless
of its principles. His expense should exceed his income considerably,
not for the necessaries, but for the superfluities of life,
that the debts he contracts may do him honor. There should be
a haughtiness and insolence in his deportment, which is supposed
to result from conscious honor. If he be choleric and wrong-headed
into the bargain, with a good deal of animal courage, he
acquires the glorious character of a man of honor; and if all
these qualifications are duly seasoned with the genteelest vices,
the man of honor is complete; anything his wife, children, servants,
or tradesmen, may think to the contrary, notwithstanding.”</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield goes on to exemplify the then modern chivalrous
guardian of honor, by drawing the portrait of a friend
under an assumed name. He paints a certain “Belville” of whom
his male friends are proud, his female friends fond, and in whom
his party glories as a living example—frequently making that
example the authority for their own conduct. He has lost a fortune
by extravagance and gambling; he is uneasy only as to how
his honor is to be intact by acquitting his liabilities from “play.”
He must raise money at any price, for, as he says, “I would
rather suffer the greatest incumbrance upon my fortune, than the
least blemish upon my honor.” His privilege as a peer will preserve
him from those “clamorous rascals, the tradesmen”; and lest
he should not be able to get money by any other means, to pay
his “debts of honor,” he writes to the prime minister and offers
to sell his vote and conscience for the consideration of fifteen
hundred pounds. He exacts his money before he records his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
vote, persuaded as he is that the minister will not be the first person
that ever questioned the honor of the chivalrous Belville.</p>

<p>The modern knight has, of course, a lady love. The latter is
as much like Guinever, of good King Arthur’s time, as can well
be; and she has a husband who is more suspicious and jealous
than the founder of the chivalrous Round Table. “Belville” can
not imagine how the lady’s husband can be suspicious, for he and
Belville have been play-fellows, school-fellows, and sworn
friends in manhood. Consequently, Belville thinks that wrong
may be committed in all confidence and security. “However,”
he writes to the lady, “be convinced that you are in the hands of
a man of honor, who will not suffer you to be ill-used, and should
my friend proceed to any disagreeable extremities with you, depend
upon it, I will cut the c——’s throat for him.”</p>

<p>Life in love, so in lying. He writes to an acquaintance that he
had “told a d——d lie last night in a mixed company,” and had
challenged a “formal old dog,” who had insinuated that “Belville”
had violated the truth. The latter requests his “dear Charles” to
be his second—“the booby,” he writes of the adversary who had
detected him in a lie, “was hardly worth my resentment, but you
know my delicacy where honor is concerned.”</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield wrote more than one paper on the subject of
men of honor. For these I refer the reader to his lordship’s
works. I will quote no further from them than to show a distinction,
which the author draws with some ingenuity. “I must observe,”
he says, “that there is a great difference between a <span class="smcap">Man
of Honor</span> and a <span class="smcap">Person of Honor</span>. By <span class="smcap">Persons of Honor</span>
were meant, in the latter part of the last century, bad authors and
poets of noble birth, who were but just not fools enough to prefix
their names in great letters to the prologues, epilogues, and sometimes
even the plays with which they entertained the public. But
now that our nobility are too generous to interfere in the trade of
us poor, professed authors” (his lordship is writing anonymously,
in the <span class="smcap">World</span>), “or to eclipse our performances by the distinguished
and superior excellency and lustre of theirs; the meaning
at present of a <span class="smcap">Person of Honor</span> is reduced to the simple idea
of a <span class="smcap">Person of Illustrious Birth</span>.”</p>

<p>The chivalrous courage of one of our admirals at the close of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
the reign of George II., very naturally excited the admiration of
Walpole. “What milksops,” he writes in 1760, “the Marlboroughs
and Turennes, the Blakes and Van Tromps appear now,
who whipped into winter quarters and into ports the moment their
nose looked blue. Sir Cloudesley Shovel said that an admiral
deserved to be broken who kept great ships out after the end of
September; and to be shot, if after October. There is Hawke in
the bay, weathering this winter (January), after conquering in a
storm.”</p>

<p>George III. was king during a longer period than any other
sovereign of England; and the wars and disasters of his reign
were more gigantic than those of any other period. He was little
of a soldier himself; was, however, constitutionally brave; and
had his courage and powers tested by other than military matters.
The politics of his reign wore his spirit more than if he had been
engaged in carrying on operations against an enemy. During
the first ten years after his accession, there were not less than
seven administrations; and the cabinets of Newcastle and Bute,
Grenville and Rockingham, Grafton and North, Shelburne and
Portland, were but so many camps, the leaders in which worried
the poor monarch worse than the Greeks badgered unhappy Agamemnon.
Under the administration of Pitt he was hardly more
at his ease, and in no degree more so under that of Addington, or
that of All the Talents, and of Spencer Perceval. An active
life of warfare could not have more worn the spirit and health of
this king than political intrigues did; intrigues, however, be it
said, into which he himself plunged with no inconsiderable delight,
and with slender satisfactory results.</p>

<p>He was fond of the display of knightly ceremonies, and was
never more pleased than when he was arranging the ceremonies
of installation, and turning the simple gentlemen into knights.
Of the sons who succeeded him, George IV. was least like him
in good principle of any sort, while William IV. surpassed him
in the circumstance of his having been in action, where he bore
himself spiritedly. The race indeed has ever been brave, and I
do not know that I can better close the chapter than with an
illustration of the “Battle-cry of Brunswick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span></p>


<p class="c">THE BATTLE-CRY OF BRUNSWICK.</p>

<p>The “Battle-cry of Brunswick” deserves to be commemorated
among the acts of chivalry. Miss Benger, in her “Memoirs of
Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia,” relates that Christian, Duke of
Brunswick, was touched alike by the deep misfortunes, and the
cheerful patience of that unhappy queen. Indignant at the neglect
with which she was treated by her father, James I. of England,
and her uncle, Frederick of Denmark, Duke Christian “seemed
suddenly inspired by a sentiment of chivalric devotion, as far removed
from vulgar gallantry as heroism from ferocity. Snatching
from her hand a glove, which he first raised with reverence to
his lips, he placed it in his Spanish hat, as a triumphal plume
which, for her sake, he ever after wore as a martial ornament;
then drawing his sword he took a solemn oath never to lay down
arms until he should see the King and Queen of Bohemia reinstated
in the Palatinate. No sooner had Christian taken this engagement
than he eagerly proclaimed it to the world, by substituting
on his ensign, instead of his denunciation of priests, an intelligible
invocation to Elizabeth in the words ‘For God and for
her!’ <i>Fur Gott und fur sie!</i>”</p>

<p>The original superscription on the banner of Brunswick was
the very energetic line: “Christian of Brunswick, the friend of
God and the enemy of priests.” Naylor, in his “Civil and Military
History of Germany,” says, that the Duke imprinted the same
legend on the money which he had coined out of the plate of which
he had plundered the convents, and he adds, in a note derived
from Galetti, that “the greater part of the money coined by Christian
was derived from twelve silver statues of the apostles, which
the bigotry of preceding ages had consecrated, in the cathedral of
Munster.” When the Duke was accused of impiety by some of
his followers, he sheltered himself under the authority of Scripture;
and pretended to have only realized the ancient precept: “Go
hence, into all parts of the earth!”</p>

<p>Having seen the English Kings as knights, let us look at a few
of the men whom they knighted.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> Conquest was productive of a far more than average quantity
of knights. Indeed, I think it may be asserted without fear
of contradiction, that the first and the last William, and James I.
were more addicted to dubbing knights than any other of our sovereigns.
The good-natured William IV. created them in such
profusion that, at last, gentlemen at the head of deputations appeared
in the royal presence with a mysterious dread lest, in spite
of themselves, they should be compelled to undergo a chivalric
metamorphosis, at the hands of the “sea king.” The honor was
so constantly inflicted, that the recipients were massed together by
“John Bull” as “The Thousand and one (K)nights!”</p>

<p>William the Conqueror was not so lavish in accolades as his
descendant of remoter days, nor was he so off-handed in the way
of administering the distinction. He drew his sword with solemnity,
laid it on the shoulder before him with a sort of majestic
composure, and throughout the ceremony looked as calm as dignity
required. William is said to have ennobled or knighted his cook.
He does not stand alone in having so acted: for, unless I am singularly
mistaken, the great Louis tied some small cross of chivalry
to the button-hole of the immortal Vatel. William’s act, however,
undoubtedly gave dignity to that department in palaces, whence
many princes have derived their only pleasure. It was from him
that there passed into the palace of France the term “Officiers de
Service,” a term which has been appropriated by others of less
elevated degree than those whom it originally served to distinguish.
The term has led to a standing joke in such dwellings. “Qui
vive?” exclaims a sentinel in one of the base passages, as one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
these officials draws near at night. “Officier,” is the reply of the
modest official in question. “Quel officier?” asks the guard.
“Officier de service!” proudly answers he who is thus questioned;
whereupon the soldier smilingly utters “Passe, Caramel!” and the
royal officer—<i>not</i> of the body-guard, passes, as smilingly, on his
way.</p>

<p>But, to return from Caramel to the Conqueror, I have to observe,
that the cook whom William knighted bore an unmusical, if
not an unsavory, name. The culinary artist was called Tezelin.
The service by which he had won knighthood consisted in the invention
of a white soup for maigre days. The hungry but orthodox
William had been accustomed to swallow a thin broth “à l’eau
de savon;” but Tezelin placed before him a tureen full of an orthodox
yet appetizing liquid, which he distinguished by the name
of <i>Dillegrout</i>. The name is not promising, particularly the last
syllable, but the dish could not have been a bad one. William
created the inventor “chevalier de l’office,” and Sir Caramel Tezelin
was farther gratified by being made Lord of the Manor of
Addington. Many a manor had been the wages of less honest
service.</p>

<p>The Tiercelins are descendants of the Tezelins; and it has often
struck me as curious that of two recently-deceased holders of that
name, one, a cutler in England, was famous for the excellence of
his carving-knives; and the other, an actor in France, used to
maintain that the first of comic parts was the compound cook-coachman
in Molière’s “<i>Avare</i>.” Thus did they seem to prove
their descent from the culinary chivalry of William of Normandy.</p>

<p>But there are other samples of William’s knights to be noticed.
Among the followers who landed with him between Pevensey and
Hastings, was a Robert who, for want of a surname, and because
of his sinews, was called Robert le Fort, or “Strong.” It would
have gone ill with William on the bloody day on which he won a
throne, had it not been for this Robert le Fort, who interposed his
escu or shield, between the skull of the Norman and the battle-axe
of a Saxon warrior. This opportune service made a “Sieur Robert”
of him who rendered it, and on the coat-of-arms awarded to
the new knight was inscribed the device which yet belongs to the
Fortescues;—“Forte Scutum Salus Ducum,”—a strong shield is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
the salvation of dukes—or leaders, as the word implies. The
Duke of Normandy could not have devised a more appropriate
motto; but he was probably helped to it by the learning and ready
wit of his chaplain.</p>

<p>The danger into which William rushed that day was productive
of dignity to more than one individual. Thus, we hear of a soldier
who, on finding William unhorsed, and his helmet beaten into his
face, remounted his commander after cleverly extricating his head
from the battered load of iron that was about it. William, later
in the day, came upon the trusty squire, fainting from the loss of
a leg and a thigh. “You gave me air when I lacked it,” said the
Conqueror, “and such be, henceforth, thy name; and for thy lost
leg and thigh, thou shalt carry them, from this day, on thy shield of
arms.” The maimed knight was made lord of broad lands in
Derbyshire; and his descendants, the Eyres, still bear a leg and
a thigh in armor, for their crest. It is too pretty a story to lose,
but if the account of these knight-makings be correct, some doubt
must be attached to that of the devices, if, as some assert, armorial
bearings were not used until many years subsequent to the battle
of Hastings. The stories are, no doubt, substantially true. William,
like James III. of Scotland, was addicted to knighting and
ennobling any individuals who rendered him the peculiar pleasures
he most coveted. Pitscottie asserts that the latter king conferred
his favors on masons and fiddlers; and we are told that he not
only made a knight of Cochrane, a mason, but also raised him to
the dignity of Earl of Mar. Cochrane, however, was an architect,
but he would have been none the worse had he been a mason—at
least, had he been a man and mason of such quality as Hugh
Millar and Allan Cuningham.</p>

<p>Although it has been often repeated that there were no knights,
in the proper sense of that word, before the period of William
the Conqueror, this must be accepted with such amount of exception
as to be almost equivalent to a denial of the assertion. There
were knights before the Conquest, but the systems differed. Thus
we know from Collier’s Ecclesiastical History that Athelstan was
knighted by Alfred; and this is said to have been the first instance
of the performance of the ceremony that can be discovered.
Here again, however, a question arises. Collier has William of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
Malmesbury for his authority. The words of this old author are:
“Athelstane’s grandfather, Alfred, seeing and embracing him
affectionately, when he was a boy of astonishing beauty and graceful
manners, had most devoutly prayed that his government
might be prosperous; indeed, he had made him a knight unusually
early, giving him a scarlet cloak, a belt studded with diamonds,
and a Saxon sword with a golden scabbard.” This, and similar
instances which might be cited, is supposed by some to prove the
existence of knights as a distinct order among the Saxons, while
others think that it may amount to nothing more than the first
bestowing of arms. Louis le Débonnaire, it is remarked, <i>ense
accinctus est</i>, received his arms at thirteen years old. But this
was in some degree “knighting,” for we read in Leland’s History
of Ireland, of Irish knighthood being conferred on recipients only
seven years old.</p>

<p>If William the Conqueror made many knights in order to celebrate
his conquest, the gentlemen with new honors did not always
obtain peaceable possession of the estates which were sometimes
added to the title. Here is an instance in the case of the ancient
family of the Kinnersleys. William’s commissioners had appeared
in Herefordshire, and in course of their predatory excursion, they
came before the castle of John de Kinnersly, an old man, who is
described as a knight, albeit some assert that there were no more
knights in England before the conquest than there was rain on the
earth before the flood. The old man who was blind, stood at his
castle-gate in front of a semicircle formed by his twelve sons.
Each had sword on thigh and halberd in hand. When the sheriffs
and other commissioners asked him by what tenure he held his
castle and estates, blind John exclaimed, “By my arms; by sword
and spear; and by the same will keep them!” To which all his
lively lads uttered a vigorous “Ay, ay,” and the Norman commissioners
were so satisfied with the title, that they did not venture
to further question the same, but left the possessor of castle
and land undisturbed in that possession which is said to be nine
points out of the ten required by the law.</p>

<p>During many reigns, no man was knighted, but who was of
some “quality,” and generally because he was particularly useful
to his own or succeeding generations. These require no notice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
Some of these introduced customs that are worth noticing, and
here is a sample.</p>

<p>Among the lucky individuals knighted by Edward I., Sir
William Baud holds a conspicuous place. Sir William gave
rise to a curious custom, which was long observed in Old
St. Paul’s. During his lifetime, the dean and chapter had
made over to him some laud in Essex. In return, or perhaps in
“service” for this, the knight presented at the high altar of the
cathedral, a doe “sweet and seasonable,” on the conversion of St.
Paul, in winter; and a buck, in equally fitting condition, on the
commemoration of St. Paul in summer. The venison was for the
especial eating of the canons resident. The doe was carried to
the altar by one man, surrounded by processional priests, and he
was to have nothing for his trouble. The buck had several bearers
and a more numerous accompaniment of priests, who disbursed
the magnificent sum of twelve pence to the carriers. The knight’s
buck made the dean and chapter so hilarious that when they appeared
at the doors of the cathedral to escort it to the altar, they
wore copes and vestments, and their reverences wore wreaths of
roses on their solemn heads! Indeed, there was a special dress
for the cathedral clergy on either day; each, according to the
occasion, being ornamented with figures of bucks or does. At
the altar, the dean sent the body to be baked, but the head was
cut off and carried on a pike to the western door, where the huntsmen
blew a <i>mort</i>, and the notes proclaiming the death of the stag
were taken up and repeated by the “horners” of the city, who
received a trifle from the rosy dean and chapter, for thus increasing
the noisy importance of the occasion.</p>

<p>There is something, too, worthy of notice in the fact that Richard
II. was the first king who knighted a London tradesman.
Walworth, who struck down Wat Tyler, and who was knighted
by that king for his good service, was engaged in commercial pursuits.
This lord mayor, however, derived very considerable profits
from pursuits less creditable to him. He was the owner of tenements
by the water side, which were of the very worst reputation,
but which brought him a very considerable yearly revenue. Sir
William pocketed this with the imperially-complacent remark of
“non olet.” The dagger in the city arms is not in memory of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
this deed; it simply represents the sword of St. Paul, and it has
decorated the city shield since the first existence of a London
municipality.</p>

<p>Walworth then is not a very respectable knight. We find one
of better character in a knight of ancient family name, whose
deeds merit some passing record.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Umfreville, a knight of the Garter, who owed his
honors to the unfortunate Henry VI., found leisure, despite the
busy and troubled times in which he lived, to found the Chantry
of Farmacres, near Ravensworth, where two chaplains were regularly
to officiate according to the law of Sarum. If the knight’s
charity was great, his expectations of benefit were not small.
The chaplains were daily to perform service for the benefit of the
souls of the founder, and of all his kith, kin, and kindred. Nay,
more than this, service was to be performed for the soul’s profit
of all knights of the Garter, as long as the order existed, and of
all the proprietors of the estate of Farmacres. The chaplains
were to reside, board, and sleep, under the roof of the chapel.
Once every two years the pious will of the founder allowed them
a renewal of costume, consisting of “a sad and sober vest sweeping
to their heels.” Upon one point Sir Robert was uncommonly
strict; he would not allow of the presence of a female in the
chapel, under any pretence whatever—even as a servant to the
chaplains—<i>quia frequenter dum colitur Martha, expellitur Maria</i>.
The latter, too, were bound to exercise no office of a secular nature,
especially that of bailiff. To a little secular amusement,
however, the sagacious knight did not object, and two months’
leave of absence was allowed to the chaplains every year; and
doubtless no questions were asked, on their return, as to how it
had been employed.</p>

<p>While touching on the matters which occurred during the reign
of that unhappy Lancastrian king, Henry VI., I will observe that
we have foreign testimony to the fact of our civil wars having
been carried on with more knightly courtesy than had hitherto
been the case in any other country. “In my humble opinion,”
says Comines, “England is, of all the dominions with which I am
acquainted, the one alone in which a public interest is properly
treated. There is no violence employed against the people, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
in war-time no edifice is destroyed or injured by the belligerents.
The fate and misery of war falls heaviest on those immediately
concerned in carrying it on.” He alludes particularly to the
knights and nobles; but it is clear that, let war be carried on in
ever so knightly a fashion, the people must be the chief sufferers.
The warehouses may stand, but so also will commerce—very still
and unproductive.</p>

<p>Courteous as the knights of this age may have been, they were
by no means incorruptible. There were many of them in the
service of Edward IV., who were the pensioners of Louis XI.,
who used to delight in exhibiting their names at the foot of acknowledgments
for money received. One official, however, Hastings,
would never attach his autograph to his receipt, but he had
no scruples with regard to taking the money. The Czar buys
Prussian service after the fashion of Louis XI.</p>

<p>Henry VIII. cared more for merit than birth in the knights
whom he created. He first recognised the abilities of him who
was afterward Sir John Mason, the eminent statesman of five
reigns. This king was so pleased with an oration delivered in his
presence by Mason, at All Souls, Oxford, that he took upon himself
the charge of having him educated abroad, as one likely to
prove an able minister of state. He was a faithful servant to the
king. Elizabeth had one as gallant in Sir Henry Unton, who
challenged the great Guise for speaking lightly of his royal mistress.
The motives for the royal patronage of these knights was
better than that which moved Richard I. when he raised the lowly-born
Will Briewer to favoriteship and knighthood. Henry VIII.
was fond of conferring the honor of chivalry on those who served
him well; thus of the Cornish lawyer, Trigonnel, he made a
knight, with forty pounds a year to help him to keep up the dignity,
in acknowledgment of the ability with which, as proctor, he
had conducted the case of divorce against Queen Katharine. It
was better service than John Tirrell rendered to Richard III.,
who knighted him for his aid in the murder of the young princes,
on which occasion he kept the keys of the Tower, and stood at
the foot of the stairs, while Forest and Dighton were despatching
the young victims. We have a knight of a different sort of reputation
in Sir Richard Hutton, Charles I.’s “honest judge,” at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
whose opposition against the levying of ship-money, even the
king could not feel displeased. Sir Richard deserved his honors;
and we may reckon among them the fact, that “when he was a
barrister at Gray’s Inn, he seldom or never took a fee of a clergyman.”</p>

<p>The old crest of the Huntingdonshire Cromwells was a lion
rampant, holding a diamond ring in its fore-paw. This crest has
reference to an individual knighted by Henry VIII. In the thirty-second
year of that king’s reign, Richard Williams, <i>aliàs</i> Cromwell,
with five other gentlemen, challenged all or any comers from
Scotland, Flanders, France, or Spain, who were willing to encounter
them in the lists. The challenge was duly accepted, and on
the day of encounter, Richard Cromwell flung two of his adversaries
from their horses. Henry loved the sport, and especially
such feats as this exhibited by Cromwell, whom he summoned to
his presence. The king said, “You have hitherto been my Dick,
now be my diamond;” and taking a diamond ring from his own
finger, and placing it on that of Cromwell, he bade the latter
always carry it for his crest. The king, moreover, knighted
Richard, and what was better, conferred on him Romney Abbey,
“on condition of his good service, and the payment of £4,663 4<i>s.</i>
2<i>d.</i> held in capite by the tenth part of a knight’s fee, paying
£29 16<i>s.</i>”</p>

<p>It was in the reign of Henry VIII. that for the first time a
serjeant-at-law received the honor of knighthood. This seems to
have been considered by the learned body as a corporate honor, by
which the entire company of sergeants were lifted to a level with
knights-bachelors, at least. It is doubtless for this reason that
sergeants-at-law claim to be equal in rank with, and decline to go
below those said knight’s bachelors.</p>

<p>Of Elizabeth, it is sufficient to name but one sample of her
knights. She created many, but she never dubbed one who
more nobly deserved the honor than when she clapped the sword
on the shoulder of Spielman, the paper-maker, and bade him rise
a knight. This was done by way of recompense for the improvements
he had introduced into his art, at a time when printers
and paper-makers were considered by Romanists anything but
angels of light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span></p>

<p>Hume, referring to the chivalry of James I.’s time, remarks
that the private soldiers were drawn from a better class of men
than was the case in Hume’s time. They approached, he says,
nearer to an equality with the rank of officers. It has been answered
that no such rank existed as that from which they are
chiefly drawn now. This, however, is not the case. There were
then, as now, doubtless many of the peasant and working classes
in the army; but there is not now, as there was then, any encouragement
to men of respectable station to begin the ascent in profession
of arms at the lowest round of the ladder.</p>

<p>One of James I.’s knights was the well-known Sir Herbert
Croft. James knighted him at Theobalds, out of respect to his
family, and personal merits. Some years subsequently Sir
Herbert, then above fifty years of age, joined the Church of
Rome, and retired to Douay, where he dwelt a lay-brother, among
the English Benedictines. He died among them, after a five
years’ residence, in the year 1622. His eldest son William was
also knighted, I think, by Charles I. He is an example of those
who were both knights and clergymen, for after serving as colonel
in the civil wars, he forsook catholicism, in which he had been
brought up by his father, entered the Church of England, and
like so many other knights who in former times had changed the
sword for the gown, rose to the dignity of carrying an episcopal
pastoral staff, and was made Bishop of Hereford in 1661. It was
a descendant of his who wrote the very inaccurate biography of
Young, in “Johnson’s Lives of the Poets.” Wood, in his <i>Athenæ</i>,
shows that the first Sir Herbert was a literary knight, who took
up pen in the service of the communion into which he had entered.
These were;—1. Letters persuasive to his wife and
children to take upon them the Catholic religion. 2. Arguments
to show that the Church, in communion with the See of Rome, is
the true Church. 3. Reply to the answers of his daughter, Mary
Croft, which she made to a paper of his sent to her concerning
the Roman Church. All these pieces appeared in the same year,
1619, and they seem to have been very harmless weapons in the
hands of a very amiable knight.</p>

<p>Among the most worthy of the knights created by James I. was
Leonard Holliday, who served the office of Lord Mayor in 1605,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
and was dubbed chevalier by a king who is said never to have
conferred the honor without being half afraid of the drawn sword
which was his instrument. Sir Leonard did good service in return.
In his time Moorfields consisted of nothing but desolate
land, the stage whereon was enacted much violence and terrible
pollution. In this savage locality, Sir Leonard effected as wonderful
a change as Louis Napoleon has done in the Bois de Boulogne;
and even a greater; for there were more difficulties in
the knight’s way, and his will was less sovereign and potent to
work mutation. Nevertheless, by perseverance, liberal outlay,
and hard work of those employed in the manual labor, he transformed
the hideous and almost pathless swamp into a smiling
garden, wherein the citizens might take the air without fearing
violence either to body or goods. They blessed king James’s
knight as they disported themselves in the rural district with their
wives and children. The laborers employed were said to have
been less lavish of benedictions upon the head of him from whom
they took their wages. They complained bitterly of the toil, and
for a long time in London, when any great exertions were necessary
to produce a desired end, promptly, men spoke of the same
as being mere “Holiday work.”</p>

<p>James I. was not so perfect a knight in presence of a sword as
he was in presence of a lady. He made more knights than any
other king, not excepting William IV.; but he never dubbed one
without some nervousness at the sight of the weapon with which
he laid on the honor. Kenelm Digby states that when <i>he</i> was
knighted by James, the sword, had it not been guided in the King’s
hand by the Duke of Buckingham, would have gone, not upon his
shoulder, but into his eye. James’s aversion from the sight of a
sword is said to have descended to him from his mother who, a
short time previous to his birth, was the terrified spectator of the
murder of Rizzio. The same King used to remark that there
were two great advantages in wearing armor, namely, that the
wearer could neither receive nor inflict much injury. Indeed, as
James sagaciously remarked, the chief inconvenience to be dreaded
from armor was in being knocked down in it, and left without
a squire to lend assistance. In this case the knight stood, or lay,
in imminent peril of suffocation; the armor being generally too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
heavy to admit of a knight rising from the ground without help.
If he lay on his face his condition was almost hopeless. The
sentiment of chivalry was, after all, not so foreign to James as is
popularly supposed. Witness the circumstance when Sully came
over here as embassador extraordinary, James made the embassador
lower his flag to the pennant of the English vessel sent out
to receive or escort him. This, however, had been well nigh construed
into an affront. The poets of this time too began to have
a chivalrous feeling for the hardships of common women. The
feeling used to be all for princesses and courtly dames, but it was
now expressed even for shop-wives, behind counters. Thus the
author of “The Fair Maid of the Inn” says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“A goldsmith keeps his wife</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wedged into his shop like a mermaid; nothing of her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be seen, that’s woman, but her upper part.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The ladies too, themselves were growing ambitious, and as
fanciful as any knight’s “dame par amour” of them all. The
Goldsmith’s daughter in “Eastward Ho!” who wants to be made
a lady, says to her “sweet knight,” “Carry me out of the scent of
Newcastle coal and the hearing of Bow bells!” and <i>à-propos</i> to
titles, let me add that, in James’s time, it was, according to Jonson—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">“—— a received heresy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That England bears no Dukes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Southey commenting on this passage, said that the title was probably
thought ominous, so many dukes having lost their heads.</p>

<p>In the second year of the reign of James I., he made not less
than three hundred knights; and on another occasion he is said to
have made two hundred and thirty-seven in six weeks. In
France, when the state was in distress, knighthood was often a
marketable commodity; but it probably was never more so there,
than it was in England under the first James. No one was more
conscious than he, when he had an unworthy person before him;
and it sometimes happened that these persons had the same uncomfortable
consciousness touching themselves. Thus, we are told
that when “an insignificant person” once held down his head, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
the king was about to knight him, James called out, “Hold up
thy head, man, I have more need to be ashamed than thou.”</p>

<p>The indiscriminate infliction of the order caused great confusion.
Knights-aldermen in the city claimed precedence of knights-commoners,
and violent was the struggle when the question was agitated.
Heralds stood forth and pleaded before “my lords,” as
lawyers do, with reference to the party by which they were retained.
One party considered it absurd that a knight who happened
to be an alderman should take precedence of one who was
only a knight. The civic dignitary, it was said, was no more above
the chivalric, than a rushlight was superior to the sun. Such an
idea, it was urged, by York against Garter, was an insult to God
and man. The case was ultimately gained by the chivalric aldermen,
simply because the knights-commoners did not care to pursue
it, or support their own privileges. York thought that knights-commoners,
though tradesmen, who <i>had</i> been lord mayors, and yet
were not now aldermen, ought to take precedence of mere alderman
knights. The commoners lost their cause by neglect; but it
has been ruled that ex-lord mayors, and provosts of Scotland, shall
precede all knights, as having been the Sovereign’s lieutenants.</p>

<p>James may be said, altogether, to have shown very little regard
for the dignity of knights generally. By creating a rank above
them, he set them a step lower in degree of precedence. This
monarch is, so to speak, the inventor of the baronet. When
money was required for the benefit of the Irish province of Ulster,
a suggestion was made that they who supplied it liberally should
have the hereditary title of “Sir” and “Baronet.” James himself
was at first a little startled at the proposition, but he soon gave it his
sanction upon Lord Salisbury observing, “Sire, the money will do
you good, and the honor will do <i>them</i> none.” James thought that
a fair bargain, and the matter was soon arranged. The knights
were not pleased, but it was intimated to them, that only two hundred
baronets would be created, and that as the titles became
extinct, no new hereditary “Sirs” would be nominated. The successors
of James did not think themselves bound by the undertaking
of their predecessor. George III. the least regarded it,
for during four or five years of his reign he created baronets at
the rate of one a-month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span></p>

<p>A particular annoyance to the poor knights was, that esquires
could purchase the title, and so leap over them at a bound, or could
be dubbed knights first, if they preferred to take that rank, by
the way. But if the knights were aggrieved, much more so were
their ladies, for the wife of a baronet was allowed precedence of
all knights’ ladies, even of those of the Garter. The baronets
themselves took precedence of all knights except of those of the
Garter; and their elder sons ranked before simple knights, whose
distinction of “Sir” they were entitled to assume, at the age of
twenty-one, if they were so minded. Few, however, availed
themselves of this privilege.</p>

<p>This matter went so much to the satisfaction of James, that he
resolved to sell another batch of baronet’s titles, and thereupon
followed his “Baronets of Nova Scotia.” All these titles were
bought of the crown, the pecuniary proceeds being applied to the
improvement of the outlying province of Nova Scotia. A sneer,
not altogether rightly directed, has been occasionally flung at these
purchased hereditary baronetcies. No doubt a title so acquired
did not carry with it so much honor as one conferred for great and
glorious service rendered to the country. But there have been
many titled sneerers whose own dignity stood upon no better basis
than that their ancestress was a king’s concubine, or the founder
of their house an obsequious slave to monarch or minister. The
first baronets, whether of Ulster or Nova Scotia, rendered some
better service than this to their country, by giving their money
for purposes of certain public good. They were not, indeed, rewarded
accordingly. They were public benefactors, only on condition
that they should be recompensed with an hereditary title.
The morality here is not very pure; the principle is not very
exalted; but a smaller outlay of morality and principle has purchased
peerages before now, and the baronets, therefore, have no
reason to be ashamed of the origin of their order. Least of all
have those baronets of later creation, men who have made large
sacrifices and rendered inestimable services to their country. On
these the rank of baronet conferred no real dignity which they
did not before possess, but it served as an acknowledgment of their
worth in the eyes of their fellow-men. I may notice here, that when
Sir Walter Scott makes record of the gallant action performed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>
at Pinkie by Ralph Sadler, when he rallied the English cavalry
so effectually as to win a battle almost lost, and seized the royal
standard of Scotland with his own hand, the biographer adds that
the rank to which the gallant Ralph was then raised—of knight-banneret,
“may be called the very pinnacle of chivalry. Knight-bannerets
could only be created by the king himself or, which was
very rare, by a person vested with such powers as to represent
his person. They were dubbed either before or after a battle, in
which the royal standard was displayed; and the person so to be
honored, being brought before the king led by two distinguished
knights or nobles, presented to the sovereign his pennon, having
an indenture like a swallow’s tail at the extremity. The king
then cut off the fished extremity, rendering the banner square,
in shape similar to that of a baron, which, thereafter, the knight-banneret
might display in every pitched field, in that more noble
form. If created by the king, the banneret took precedence of
all other knights, but if by a general, only of knights of the Bath
and knights-bachelors. Sir Francis Brian, commander of the
light horsemen, and Sir Ralph Vane, lieutenant of the men-at-arms,
received this honor with our Sir Ralph Sadler, on the field
of Pinkie. But he survived his companions, and is said to have
been the last knight-banneret of England.”</p>

<p>I suppose Washington thought that he had as much right as the
English Protector to dub knights; which is not, indeed, to be disputed.
But Washington went further than Cromwell, inasmuch
as that he instituted an order. This was, what it was said to be,
trenching on the privilege of a king. It was a military order,
and was named after the agricultural patriot, who was summoned
from his plough to guide the destinies of Rome; for the Romans
had a very proper idea that nations created their own destinies.
The order of Cincinnatus being decreed, the insignia of the order
were sent to Lafayette, then in Paris, where the nobility, who
could no more spell than Lord Duberly, trusting to their ears
only, took it for the order of St. Senatus. A little uproar ensued.
The aristocracy not only sneered at the American Dictator for
assuming the “hedging” of a king, but they considered also that
he had encroached upon the privileges of a pope, and, as they
had searched the calendar and could not find a St. Senatus, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
at once came to the conclusion that he had canonized some deserving
but democratic individual of the city of Boston.</p>

<p>The commonwealth knights, whether in the naval or land service,
had perhaps less of refined gallantry than prevailed among
the “Cavaliers” <i>par excellence</i>. Thus it was a feat of which old
chivalry would have been ashamed—that of Admiral Batten,
when he cannonaded the house in which Queen Henrietta Maria
was sleeping, at Bridlington, and drove her into the fields. But,
what do I say touching the gallant refinement on the respective
sides?—after all, the rudeness of Batten was civility itself compared
with the doings of Goring and his dragoons. On the other
hand, there was not a man in arms, in either host, who in knightly
qualifications excelled Hampden—“a supreme governor over all
his passions and affections, and having thereby a great power over
those of other men.” With regard to Cromwell himself, Madame
de Sévigné has remarked, that there were some things in which
the great Turenne resembled him. This seems to me rather a
compliment to Turenne than to the Protector. The latter, like
Hampden could conceal, at least, if he could not govern his passions.
He had the delicacy of knighthood; and he was not such
a man as Miles Burket, who, in his prayer on the Sunday after
the execution of the king, asked the Almighty if he had not smelt
a sweet savor of blood?</p>

<p>The fighting chivalry of Goring, let me add, was nevertheless
perfect. The courtesies of chivalry were not his; but in ability
and bravery he was never surpassed. His dexterity is said to
have been especially remarkable in sudden emergencies; and it
was this dexterity that used to be most praised in the knight of
olden times. Many other cavaliers were poor soldiers, but admirable
company.</p>

<p>The fierce but indomitable spirit of chivalry, on the other hand,
that spirit which will endure all anguish without relinquishing an
iota of principle, or yielding an inch of ground in the face of
overwhelming numbers, was conspicuous in other men besides the
martial followers of Cromwell. I will only instance the case of
Prynne, who, under the merciless scourge, calmly preached against
tyranny; and with his neck in the pillory, boldly wagged his
tongue against cruelty and persecution. “Freeborn John” was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
gagged for his audacity, but when he was thus rendered speechless,
he stamped incessantly with his unshackled feet, to express
that he was invincible and unconvinced still. If this was not as
great courage as ever was shown by knight, I know not what to
call it.</p>

<p>Against the courage of Cromwell, Dugdale and Roger Manby
say more than can ever be alleged against Prynne—namely, that
his heart failed him once in his life. It is said, that when he was
captain of a troop of horse in Essex’s regiment, at Edgehill, “he
absented himself from the battle, and observing, from the top of a
neighboring steeple the disorder that the right wing sustained from
Prince Rupert, he was so terrified, that slipping down in haste by
a bell-rope, he took horse, and ran away with his troop, for which
cowardice he had been cashiered, had it not been for the powerful
mediation of his friends.” This passage shows that the legendary
style of the chivalrous romance still was followed as an example
by historians. Indeed romance itself claimed Oliver for a hero,
as it had done with many a knight before him. It was gravely
told of him that, before the battle of Worcester, he went into a
wood, like any Sir Tristram, where he met a solemn old man with
a roll of parchment in his hand. Oliver read the roll—a compact
between him and the Prince of Darkness, and was heard to
say, “This is only for seven years; I was to have had one for
one-and-twenty.” “Then,” says the Chronicler, “he stood out
for fourteen; but the other replied, that if he would not take it
on those terms, there were others who would. So he took the
parchment and died that day seven years.” This is history after
the model of the Seven Champions.</p>

<p>The observance of knightly colors was kept up in the contest
between commonwealth men and the crown. Those of Essex
were deep yellow; and so acute were the jealousies of war, that
they who wore any other were accounted as disaffected to the good
cause.</p>

<p>I have remarked before, that Siri puts blame upon the Scottish
men-at-arms, whose alleged mercenary conduct was said to
have been the seed of a heavy crop of evil. The Scots seem to
have been unpopular on all sides. Before the catastrophe, which
ended king and kingdom, the French embassador, then in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
north, was escorted to some point by a troop of Scots horse. On
leaving them, he drew out half-a-crown piece, and asked them how
many pence it contained. “Thirty,” was the ready-reckoned
answer of an arithmetical carabinier. “Exactly so!” replied the
envoy, flinging the piece among them with as much contempt as the
Prince of Orange felt respect, when he threw his cross among the
Dutch troops at Waterloo. “Exactly so! take it. It was the
price for which Judas betrayed his master.”</p>

<p>If the saints were unsainted in the time of the commonwealth,
they found some compensation at the hands of Mr. Penry, the
author of Martin Mar-Prelate, who chose to knight the most distinguished—and
this not only did he do to the male, but to the
female saints. The facetious Penry, accordingly, spoke of Sir
Paul, Sir Peter, and Sir Martin, and also of Sir Margaret and
Sir Mary.</p>

<p>Passing on to later times, those of James II., I may observe
that Poor Nat Lee, when mad, said of a celebrated knight of this
time, Sir Roger Lestrange, that the difference between the two
was that one was Strange Lee, the other Lestrange. “You poor
in purse,” said Lee, “as I am poor in brains.” Sir Roger was
certainly less richly endowed mentally than the poet, but he had
<i>one</i> quality which a knight of old was bound to have, above most
men who were his contemporaries—namely, intense admiration
for the ladies. This gallantry he carried so far that when he was
licenser of books, it is said that he would readily wink at unlicensed
volumes, if the printer’s wife would only smile at him.</p>

<p>Though not exactly germane to the immediate subject of Sir
Roger, I will notice here that it was the custom for children, as
late as the reign of James II., on first meeting their parents in
the morning, to kneel at their feet and ask a blessing. This was
an observance seldom omitted in the early days of chivalry by
knights who encountered a priest. We often hear praises of this
filial reverence paid by errant knights to the spiritual fathers whom
they encountered in their wanderings.</p>

<p>Another social custom connected with chivalry was still observed
during this, and even during the reign of William III. It is
noticed by Dryden, in the dedication to his “Love Triumphant,”
in the following words:—“It is the usual practice of our decayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
gentry to look about them for some illustrious family, and then fix
their young darling where he may be both well-educated and supported.”
The knightly courage and the education were not <i>always</i>
of the highest quality, if we might put implicit faith in the passage
in Congreve’s <i>Old Bachelor</i>, wherein it is said, “the habit of a
soldier now-a-days as often cloaks cowardice, as a black coat does
atheism.” But the stage is not to be taken as fairly holding the
mirror up to nature; and for my part, I do not credit the assertion
of that stage-knight, Sir Harry Wildair, that in England,
“honesty went out with the slashed doublets, and love with the
close-bodied gown.” Nor do I altogether credit what is said of
Queen Anne’s time, in the <i>Fair Quaker of Deal</i>, that “our sea-chaplains,
generally speaking, are as drunk as our sea-captains.”</p>

<p>William III. knighted many a man who did not merit the honor,
but he was guilty of no such mistake when he laid the sword of
chivalry on the shoulders of honest Thomas Abney, citizen of
London. Abney was one of those happy architects who build up
their own fortunes, and upon a basis of rectitude and commonsense.
In course of time, he achieved that greatness which is
now of so stupendous an aspect in the eyes of the Parisians; in
other words, he became Lord Mayor of London. The religious
spirit of chivalry beat within the breast that was covered with
broadcloth, and Sir Thomas Abney humbled himself on the day
on which he was exalted. He had been “brought up” a dissenter,
but he certainly was not one when he became sovereign of the
city in the year 1700. He was none the less a Christian, and it
is an exemplary and an agreeable trait that we have of him, as
illustrated in his conduct on the day of his inauguration. The
evening banquet was still in progress, when he silently withdrew
from the glittering scene, hurried home, read evening prayers to
such of his household as were there assembled on the festive day,
and then calmly returned and resumed his place among the joyous
company.</p>

<p>This knight’s hospitality was of the same sterling quality. Who
forgets that to him Dr. Watts (that amiable intolerant!) was indebted
during thirty years for a home? The Abney family had
a respect for the author of “the Sluggard,” which never slept. It
almost reached idolatry. I have said thirty years, but in truth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
Dr. Watts was at home, at the hearth of Sir Thomas, during no
briefer a period than six-and-thirty years. The valetudinarian
poet, the severity of whose early studies had compelled him to bid
an eternal <i>vale</i> to the goddess of health, was welcomed by the
knight, with an honest warmth born of respect for the worth and
genius of a kind-hearted man who “scattered damnation” in gentle
rhymes, and yet who would not have hurt a worm. In the little
paradise where he was as much at ease as his precarious health
would allow, it is astonishing with what vigor of spirit and weakness
of phrase the good-intentioned versifier thrust millions from
the gates of a greater paradise. Such at least was my own early
impression of the rhymes of the knight’s guest. They inspired
much fear and little love: and if I can see now that such was not
the author’s design, and that he only used menace to secure obedience,
that thereby affection might follow, I still am unable to come to any
other conclusion, than that the method adopted is open to censure.</p>

<p>He sat beneath the knightly roof, without a want unsupplied,
with every desire anticipated; exempted from having to sustain
an active share of the warfare in the great battle of life, he was
beset by few, perhaps by no temptations; and free from every
care, he had every hour of the day wherein to walk with God.
His defect consisted in forgetting that other men, and the children
of men, had not his advantage, and while, rightly enough, he accounted
their virtue as nothing, he had no bowels of compassion
for their human failings. It is well to erect a high standard, but
it is not less so to console rather than condemn those who fall short
of it. “Excelsior” is a good advice, on a glorious banner, but
they who are luxuriously carried on beneath its folds should not
be hasty to condemn those who faint by the way, fall back, and
await the mercy of God, whereby to attain the high prize which
they had for their chief object. I should like to know if Sir
Thomas ever disputed the conclusions adopted by his guest.</p>

<p>This mention of the metropolitan knight and the poet who sat
at his hearth, reminds me of a patron and guest of another quality,
who were once well known in the neighborhood of Metz;—“Metz
<i>sans</i> Lorraine,” as the proud inhabitants speak of a free locality
which was surrounded by, but was never <i>in</i> Lorraine.</p>

<p>The patron was an old chevalier de St. Louis, with a small cross<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>
and large “aîles de pigeon.” The guest was the parish priest,
who resided under his roof, and was the “friend of the house.”
The parish was a poor one, but it had spirit enough to raise a subscription
in order to supply the altar with a new <i>ciborium</i>—the
vessel which holds the “body of the Lord.” With the modest
sum in hand, the Knight of St. Louis, accompanied by the priest,
repaired to Metz, to make the necessary purchase. The orthodox
goldsmith placed two vessels before them. One was somewhat
small, but suitable to the funds at the knight’s disposal; the other
was large, splendidly chased, and highly coveted by the priest.</p>

<p>“Here is a pretty article,” said the chevalier, pointing to the
simpler of the two vessels: “But here is a more worthy,” interrupted
the priest. “It corresponds with the sum at our disposal,”
remarked the former. “I am sure it does not correspond with
your love for Him for whom the sum was raised,” was the rejoinder.
“I have no authority to exceed the amount named,” whispered the
cautious chevalier. “But you have wherewith of your own to
supply the deficiency,” murmured the priest. The perplexed
knight began to feel himself a dissenter from the church, and after
a moment’s thought, and looking at the smaller as well as the simpler
of the two vessels, he exclaimed—“it is large enough for the
purpose, and will do honor to the church.” “The larger would
be more to the purpose, and would do more honor to the Head of
the Church,” was the steady clerical comment which followed.
“Do you mean to say that it is <i>not</i> large enough?” asked the
treasurer. “Certainly, since there is a larger, which we may
have, if you will only be generous.” “<i>Mais!</i>” remonstrated the
knight, in a burst of profane impatience, and pointing to the smaller
ciborium, “Cela contiendroit le diable!” “Ah, Monsieur le Chevalier,”
said the priest, by no means shocked at the idiomatic phrase.
“Le Bon Dieu est plus grand que le diable!” This stroke won
the day, and the goldsmith was the most delighted of the three, at
this conclusion to a knotty argument.</p>

<p>George I. was not of a sufficiently generous mind to allow of
his distributing honors very profusely. The individuals, however,
who were eminently useful to him were often rewarded by being
appointed to enjoy the emoluments, if not exercise the duties of
several offices, each in his own person. At a period when this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
was being done in England, the exact reverse was being accomplished
in Spain. Thus we read in the <i>London Gazette</i> of March
29 to April 1, 1718, under the head of Madrid, March 21, the following
details, which might be put to very excellent profit in
England in these more modern times:—</p>

<p>“The King having resolved that no person shall enjoy more
than one office in his service, notice has been given to the Duke
d’Arco, who is Master of the Horse, and Gentleman of the Bedchamber;
the Marquis de Montelegre, Lord Chamberlain and
Captain of the Guard of Halberdiers; the Marquis de St. Juan,
Steward of the Household, and Master of the Horse to the Queen;
and one of the Council of the Harinda, the Marquis de Bedmar,
the Minister of War, and President of the Council; and several
others who are in the like case, to choose which of their employments
they will keep. To which they have all replied that they
will make no claim, but will be determined by what his Majesty
shall think fit to appoint. The like orders are given in the army,
where they who receive pay as General Officers, and have Colonels’
commissions besides, are obliged to part with their regiments.”</p>

<p>This regulation seriously disturbed the revenue of many a Spanish
knight; but it was a wise and salutary regulation, nevertheless.
At the very period of its being established, Venice was selling her
titles of knighthood and nobility. In the same Gazette from which
the above details are extracted, I find it noticed, under the head
of “Venice, March 25,” that “Signor David, and Paul Spinelli,
two Geneva gentlemen, were, upon their petition, admitted this
week by the Grand Council, into the Order of the Nobility of this
Republic, having purchased that honor for a hundred thousand
ducats.” It was a large price for so small a privilege.</p>

<p>I have treated of knighthood under George II., sufficiently at
length, when speaking of that king himself; and I will add only
one trait of his successor.</p>

<p>It was not often that George III. was facetious, but tradition
has attributed to him a compound pun, when he was urged by his
minister to confer knighthood upon Judge Day, on the return of
the latter from India. “Pooh! pooh!” remonstrated the king,
“how can I turn a Day into night?” On the ministerial application<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
being renewed, the king asked, if Mr. Day was married, and
an affirmative reply being given, George III. immediately rejoined,
“Then let him come to the next drawing-room, and I will perform
a couple of miracles; I will not only turn Day into Knight, but I
will make Lady-Day at Christmas.”</p>

<p>There was a saying of George III. which, put into practice, was
as beneficial as many of the victories gained by more chivalrous
monarchs. “The ground, like man, was never intended to be
idle. If it does not produce something useful it will be overrun
with weeds.”</p>

<p>Among the men whom James I. knighted, was one who had
passed through the career of a page, and notice of whom I have
reserved, that I might contrast his career with that of a contemporary
and well-known squire.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c27">RICHARD CARR, PAGE; AND GUY FAUX,<br>
ESQUIRE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Of</span> all the adventurers of the seventeenth century, I do not
know any who so well illustrate the objects I have in view, as the
two above-named gentlemen. The first commenced life as a page;
the second was an esquire by condition, and a man-at-arms.
Master Faux, for attempting murder, suffered death; and Richard
Carr, although he was convicted of murder, was suffered to live
on, and was not even degraded from knighthood.</p>

<p>When the Sixth James of Scotland reigned, a poor king in a
poor country, there was among his retinue a graceful boy—a scion
of the ancient house of Fernyhurst, poor in purse, and proud in
name. At the court of the extravagant yet needy Scottish king,
there was but scant living even for a saucy page; and Richard
Carr of Fernyhurst turned his back on Mid Lothian, and in
foreign travel forgot his northern home.</p>

<p>James, in his turn, directed his face toward the English border;
and subsequently, in the vanities of Whitehall, the hunting at
Theobald’s, the vicious pleasure of Greenwich, and the roysterings
at Royston, he forgot the graceful lad who had ministered to
him at Holyrood, St. Andrews, and Dunbar.</p>

<p>When this James I. of England had grown nearly tired of his
old favorite and minister, Salisbury, for want of better employment
he ordered a tilting match, and the order was obeyed with
alacrity. In this match Lord Hay resolved to introduce to the
King’s notice a youth who enjoyed his lordship’s especial patronage.
Accordingly, when the monarch was seated in his tribune,
and the brazen throats of the trumpets had bidden the rough
sport to begin, the young squire of Lord Hay, a handsome youth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
of twenty, straight of limb, fair of favor, strong-shouldered,
smooth-faced, and with a modesty that enhanced his beauty, rode
up on a fiery steed, to lay his master’s shield and lance at the feet
of the monarch. The action of the apprentice warrior was so
full of grace, his steed so full of fire, and both so eminently beautiful,
that James was lost in admiration. But suddenly, as the
youth bent forward to present his master’s device, his spur pricked
the flank of his charger, and the latter, with a bound and a plunge,
threw his rider out of the saddle, and flung young Carr of Fernyhurst,
at the feet of his ex-master, the King. The latter recognised
his old page, and made amends for the broken leg got in the
fall, by nursing the lad, and making him Viscount Rochester, as
soon as he was well. James created him knight of the Garter,
and taught him grammar. Rochester gave lessons to the King in
foreign history. The ill-favored King walked about the court
with his arms round the neck of the well-favored knight. He was
for ever either gazing at him or kissing him; trussing his points,
settling his curls, or smoothing his hose. When Rochester was
out of the King’s sight James was mindful of him, and confiscated
the estates of honest men in order to enrich his own new
favorite. He took Sherborne from the widow and children of
Raleigh, with the cold-blooded remark to the kneeling lady, “I
maun have it for Carr!”</p>

<p>Rochester was a knight who ruled the King, but there was
another knight who ruled Rochester. This was the well-born,
hot-headed, able and vicious Sir Thomas Overbury. Overbury
polished and polluted the mind of Rochester; read all documents
which passed through the hands of the latter, preparatory to
reaching those of the King, and not only penned Rochester’s
own despatches, but composed his love-letters for him. How
pointedly Sir Thomas could write may be seen in his “Characters;”
and as a poet, the knight was of no indifferent reputation
in his day.</p>

<p>Rochester, Sir Thomas, and the King, were at the very height
of their too-warm friendship, when James gave Frances Howard,
the daughter of the Earl of Suffolk, in marriage to young Devereux,
Earl of Essex. The bride was just in her teens. The
bridegroom was a day older. The Bishop of Bath and Wells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
blessed them in the presence of the King, and Ben Jonson and
Inigo Jones constructed a masque in honor of the occasion.
When the curtain fell, bride and bridegroom went their separate
ways; the first to her mother; the second to school. Four years
elapsed ere they again met; and then Frances, who had been ill-trained
by her mother, seduced by Prince Henry, and wooed by
Rochester, looked upon Essex with infinite scorn. Essex turned
from her with disgust.</p>

<p>Rochester then resolved to marry Frances, and Frances employed
the poisoner of Paternoster-row, Mrs. Turner, and a certain
Dr. Forman, to prepare philters that should make more ardent the
flame of the lover, and excite increased aversion in the breast of
the husband. Overbury, with intense energy, opposed the idea
of the guilty pair, that a divorce from Essex was likely to be procured.
He even spoke of the infamy of the lady, to her lover.
Frances, thereupon, offered a thousand pounds to a needy knight,
Sir John Ward, to slay Overbury in a duel. Sir John declined
the offer. A more successful method was adopted. Sir Thomas
Overbury was appointed embassador to Russia, and on his refusing
to accept the sentence of banishment, he was clapped into the
tower as guilty of contempt toward the king. In that prison, the
literary knight was duly despatched by slow poison. The guilt
was brought home less to Rochester than to Frances, but
the King himself appears to have been very well content at the
issue.</p>

<p>James united with Rochester and the lady to procure a divorce
between the latter and Essex. The King was bribed by a sum
of £25,000. Essex himself did not appear. Every ecclesiastical
judge was recompensed who pronounced for the divorce—carried
by seven against five, and even the son of one of them was
knighted. This was the heir of Dr. Bilson, Bishop of Winchester,
and he was ever afterward known by the name of Sir Nullity
Bilson.</p>

<p>Sir Nullity danced at the wedding of the famous or infamous
pair; and never was wedding more splendid. King, peers, and
illustrious commoners graced it with their presence. The diocesan
of Bath and Wells pronounced the benediction. The Dean of St.
Paul’s wrote for the occasion an epithalamic eclogue. The Dean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
of Westminster supplied the sermon. The great Bacon composed,
in honor of the event, the “Masque of Flowers;” and the City
made itself bankrupt by the extravagant splendor of its fêtes. One
gentleman horsed the bride’s carriage, a bishop’s lady made the
bride’s cake, and one humorous sycophant offered the married
pair the equivocal gift of a gold warming-pan.</p>

<p>The King, not to be behindhand in distributing honors, conferred
one which cost him nothing. He created Rochester Earl
of Somerset.</p>

<p>Two years after this joyous wedding, the gentleman who had
made a present to the bride, of four horses to draw her in a gilded
chariot to the nuptial altar, had become a knight and secretary of
state. Sir Richard (or, as some call him, Sir Robert) Winwood
was a worshipper of the now rising favorite, Villiers; and none
knew better than this newly-made knight that the King was utterly
weary of his old favorite, Somerset.</p>

<p>Winwood waited on the King and informed him that a garrulous
young apothecary at Flushing, who had studied the use of drugs
under Dr. Franklin of London, was making that melancholy town
quite lively, by his stories of the abuses of drugs, and the method
in which they had been employed by Lord and Lady Somerset,
Mrs. Turner (a pretty woman, who invented yellow starched ruffs)
and their accomplices, in bringing about the death of Overbury.
The food conveyed to the latter was poisoned by Frances and her
lover, outside the tower, and was administered to the imprisoned
knight by officials within the walls, who were bribed for the purpose.</p>

<p>There is inextricable confusion in the details of the extraordinary
trial which ensued. It is impossible to read them without the
conviction that some one higher in rank than the Somersets was
interested, if not actually concerned, in the death of Overbury.
The smaller personages were hanged, and Mrs. Turner put yellow
ruffs out of fashion by wearing them at the gallows.</p>

<p>Lady Somerset pleaded <i>guilty</i>, evidently under the influence of
a promise of pardon, if she did so, and of fear lest Bacon’s already
prepared speech, had she pleaded <i>not guilty</i>, might send her to an
ignominious death. She was confined in the Tower, and she implored
with frantic energy, that she might not be shut up in the
room which had been occupied by Overbury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span></p>

<p>Somerset appeared before his judges in a solemn suit, and wearing
the insignia of the Garter. He pleaded <i>not guilty</i>, but despite
insufficiency of legal evidence he was convicted, and formally condemned
to be hanged, like any common malefactor. But the ex-page
won his life by his taciturnity. Had he, in his defence, or
afterward, revealed anything that could have displeased or disturbed
the King, his life would have paid the forfeit. As it was,
the King at once ordered that the Earl’s heraldic arms as knight
of the Garter should not be taken down. For the short period of
the imprisonment of the guilty pair, both guilty of many crimes,
although in the matter of Overbury there is some doubt as to the
extent of the Earl’s complicity, they separately enjoyed the “Liberty
of the Tower.” The fallen favorite was wont to pace the
melancholy ramparts with the George and collar round his neck
and the Garter of knighthood below his knee. He was often seen
in grave converse with the Earl of Northumberland. Sometimes,
the guilty wife of Somerset, impelled by curiosity or affection,
would venture to gaze at him for a minute or two from her lattice,
and then, if the Earl saw her, he would turn, gravely salute her,
and straightway pass on in silence.</p>

<p>When liberated from the Tower, the knight of the Garter, convicted
of murder, and his wife, confessedly guilty, went forth together
under protection of a royal pardon. Down to the time
of the death of Lady Somerset, in 1632, the wretched pair are
said never to have opened their lips but to express, each hatred
and execration of the other. The earl lived on till 1645—long
enough to see the first husband of his wife carry his banner triumphantly
against the son of James, at Edgehill. The two husbands
of one wife died within a few months of each other.</p>

<p>Such was the career of one who began life as a page. Let us
contrast therewith the early career of one whose name is still more
familiar to the general reader.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the sixteenth century there was established
at York a respectable and influential Protestant family of
the name of Fawkes. Some of the members were in the legal
profession, others were merchants. One was registrar and advocate
of the Consistory Court of the cathedral church of York.
Another was notary and proctor. A third is spoken of as a merchant-stapler.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
All were well to-do; but not one of them dreamed
that the name of Fawkes was to be in the least degree famous.</p>

<p>The Christian name of the ecclesiastical lawyer was Edward.
He was the third son of William and Ellen Fawkes, and was the
favorite child of his mother. She bequeathed trinkets, small sums,
and odd bits of furniture to her other children, but to Edward she
left her wedding suit, and the residue of her estate. Edward
Fawkes was married when his mother made her will. While the
document was preparing, his wife Edith held in her arms an infant
boy. To this boy she left her “best whistle, and one old angel of
gold.”</p>

<p>The will itself is a curious document. It is devotional, according
to the good custom of the days in which it was made. The
worthy old testator made some singular bequests; to her son
Thomas, amid a miscellaneous lot, she specifies, “my second petticoat,
my worsted gowne, gardit with velvet, and a damask kirtle.”
The “best kirtle and best petticoat” are bequeathed to her daughter-in-law
Edith Fawkes. Among the legatees is a certain John
(who surely must have been a <i>Joan</i>) Sheerecrofte, to whom, says
Mistress Fawkes, “I leave my petticoat fringed about, my woorse
grogram kirtle, one of my lynn smockes, and a damask upper
bodie.” The sex, however, of the legatee is not to be doubted, for
another gentleman in Mrs. Fawkes’s will comes in for one of her
bonnets!</p>

<p>The amount of linen bequeathed, speaks well for the lady’s
housewifery; while the hats, kirtles, and rings, lead us to fear that
the wife of Master Edward Fawkes must have occasionally startled
her husband with the amount of little accounts presented to him
by importunate dressmakers, milliners, and jewellers. Such, however,
was the will of a lady of York three centuries ago, and the
child in arms who was to have the silver whistle and a gold angel
was none other than our old acquaintance, known to us as Guy
Faux.</p>

<p>Guy was christened on the sixteenth of April, 1570, in the still
existing church of St. Michael le Belfry; and when the gossips
and sponsors met round the hospitable table of the paternal lawyer
to celebrate the christening of his son, the health of Master Guy
followed hard upon that of her gracious highness the queen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span></p>

<p>Master Guy had the misfortune to lose his father in his ninth
year. “He left me but small living,” said Guy, many years afterward,
“and I spent it.” After his sire’s decease, Guy was for
some years a pupil at the free foundation grammar-school in “the
Horse Fayre,” adjacent to York. There he accomplished his humanities
under the Reverend Edward Pulleyne. Among his
schoolfellows were Bishop Morton, subsequently Bishop of Durham,
and a quiet little boy, named Cheke, who came to be a
knight and baronet, and who, very probably went, in after-days, to
see his old comrade in the hands of the hangman.</p>

<p>Some seventeen miles from York stands the pleasant town of
Knaresborough, and not far from Knaresborough is the village of
Scotten. When Guy was yet a boy, there lived in this village a
very gay, seductive wooer, named Dennis Baynbridge. This
wooer was wont to visit the widowed Edith, and the result of his
visits was that the widowed Edith rather hastily put away her
weeds, assumed a bridal attire, married the irresistible Dennis,
and, with her two daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, and her only
son Guy, accompanied her new husband to his residence at
Scotten.</p>

<p>Baynbridge was a Roman Catholic, as also were the Pullens,
Percies, Winters, Wrights, and others who lived in Scotten or its
neighborhood, and whose names figure in the story of the Gunpowder
Plot.</p>

<p>At Scotten, then, and probably soon after his mother’s marriage,
in 1582, Guy, it may be safely said, left the faith in which he had
been baptized, for that of the Romish Church. Had he declined
to adopt the creed of his step-sire, he perhaps would have been
allowed but few opportunities of angling in the Nidd, rabbiting by
Bilton Banks, nutting in Goldsborough Wood, or of passing idle
holydays on Grimbald Craig.</p>

<p>On the wedding-day of Edith Fawkes and Dennis Baynbridge,
the paternal uncle of Guy made his will. He exhibited his sense
of the step taken by the lady, by omitting her name from the will,
and by bequeathing the bulk of his property to the two sisters of
Guy. To Guy himself, Uncle Thomas left only “a gold ring,”
and a “bed and one pair of sheets, with the appurtenances.”</p>

<p>When Guy became of age, he found himself in possession of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
patrimony—some land and a farm-house. The latter, with two
or three acres of land, he let to a tailor, named Lumley, for the
term of twenty-one years, at the annual rent of forty-two shillings.
The remainder he sold at once for a trifle less than thirty pounds.
Shortly after, he made over to a purchaser all that was left of his
property. He bethought himself for a while as to what course he
should take, and finally he chose the profession of arms, and went
out to Spain, to break crowns and to win spurs.</p>

<p>In Spain, he fell into evil company and evil manners. He saw
enough of hard fighting, and indulged, more than enough, in hard
drinking. He was wild, almost savage of temper, and he never
rose to a command which gave him any chance of gaining admission
on the roll of chivalry. There was a knight, however, named
Catesby, who was a comrade of Guy, and the latter clung to him
as a means whereby to become as great as that to which he clung.</p>

<p>Guy bore himself gallantly in Spain; and, subsequently, in
Flanders, he fought with such distinguished valor, that when
Catesby and his associates in England were considering where
they might find the particular champion whom they needed for
their particular purpose in the Gunpowder Plot, the thought of
the reckless soldier flashed across the mind of Catesby, and Guy
was at once looked after as the “very properest man” for a very
improper service.</p>

<p>The messenger who was despatched to Flanders to sound Guy,
found the latter eager to undertake the perilous mission of destroying
king and parliament, and thereby helping Rome to lord it again
in England. The English soldier in Flanders came over to London,
put up at an inn, which occupied a site not very distant from
that of the once well-known “Angel” in St. Clement’s Danes, and
made a gay figure in the open Strand, till he was prepared to consummate
a work which he thought would help himself to greatness.</p>

<p>Into the matter of the plot I will not enter. It must be observed,
however, that knight never went more coolly to look death
in the face than Guy went to blow up the Protestant king and the
parliament. At the same time it must be added, that Guy had
not the slightest intention of hoisting himself with his own petard.
He ran a very great risk, it is true, and he did it fearlessly; but
the fact that both a carriage and a boat were in waiting to facilitate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
his escape, shows that self-sacrifice was not the object of the
son of the York proctor. His great ambition was to rank among
knights and nobles. He took but an ill-method to arrive at such
an object; but his reverence for nobility was seen even when he
was very near to his violent end. If he was ever a hero, it was
when certain death by process of law was before him. But even
then it was his boast and solace, that throughout the affair there
was not a man employed, even to handle a spade, in furtherance
of the end in view, who was not a gentleman. Guy died under
the perfect conviction that he had done nothing derogatory to his
quality!</p>

<p>Considering how dramatic are the respective stories of the page
and squire, briefly noticed above, it is remarkable that so little use
has been made of them by dramatists. Savage is the only one
who has dramatized the story of the two knights, Somerset and
Overbury. In this tragedy bearing the latter knight’s name, and
produced at the Haymarket, in June, 1723, he himself played the
hero, Sir Thomas. His attempt to be an actor, and thus gain an
honest livelihood by his industry, was the only act of his life of
which Savage was ever ashamed. In this piece the only guilty
persons are the countess and her uncle, the Earl of Northampton.
This is in accordance with the once-prevailing idea that Northampton
planned the murder of Sir Thomas, in his residence, which
occupied the site of the present Northumberland house. The play
was not successful, and the same may be said of it when revived,
with alterations, at Covent Garden, in 1777. Sheridan, the actor,
furnished the prologue. In this production he expressed his belief
that the public generally felt little interest in the fate of knights
and kings. The reason he assigns is hardly logical.</p>

<p>Guy Faux, who, when in Spain, was the ’squire of the higher-born
Catesby, has inspired but few dramatic writers. I only know
of two. In Mrs. Crouch’s memoirs, notice is made of an afterpiece,
brought out on the 5th of November, 1793, at the Haymarket.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
A far more creditable attempt to dramatize the story of
Guy Fawkes was made with great success at the Coburg (Victoria)
theatre, in September, 1822. This piece still keeps possession of
the minor stage, and deservedly; but it has never been played
with such effect as by its first “cast.” O. Smith was the Guy,
and since he had played the famous Obi, so well as to cause
Charles Kemble’s impersonation at the Haymarket to be forgotten,
he had never been fitted with a character which suited him so admirably.
It was one of the most truthful personations which the
stage had ever seen. Indeed the piece was played by such a troop
of actors as can not now be found in theatres of more pretensions
than the transpontine houses. The chivalric Huntley, very like
the chivalric Leigh Murray, in more respects than one, enacted
<i>Tresham</i> with a rare ability, and judicious Chapman played <i>Catesby</i>
with a good taste, which is not to be found now in the same locality.
Dashing Stanley was the <i>Monteagle</i>, and graceful Howell
the <i>Percy</i>, Beverly and Sloman gave rough portraits of the king
and the facetious knight, <i>Sir Tristam Collywobble</i>—coarse but
effective. Smith, however, was the soul of the piece, and Mr.
Fawkes, of Farnley, might have witnessed the representation,
and have been proud of his descent from the dignified hero that
O. Smith made of his ancestor.</p>

<p>I have given samples of knights of various qualities, but I have
yet to mention the scholar and poet knights. There are many
personages who would serve to illustrate the knight so qualified,
but I know of none so suitable as Ulrich Von Hutten.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Ulrich von Hutten</span> was born on the 21st of April, 1488,
in the castle of Stackelberg, near Fulda, in Franconia. He was
of a noble family—all the men of which were brave, and all the
women virtuous. He had three brothers and two sisters. His
tender mother loved him the most, because he was the weakest of
her offspring. His father loved him the least for the same reason.
For a like cause, however, both parents agreed that a spiritual
education best accorded with the frame of Ulrich. The latter, at
eleven years old, was accordingly sent to learn his humanities in
the abbey school at Fulda.</p>

<p>His progress in all knowledge, religious and secular, made him
the delight of the stern abbot and of his parents. Every effort
possible was resorted to, to induce him to devote himself for ever
to the life of the cloister. In his zealous opposition to this he was
ably seconded by a strong-handed and high-minded knight, a friend
of his father’s named Eitelwolf von Stein. This opposition so
far succeeded, that in 1504, when Ulrich was sixteen years of age
he fled from the cloister-academy of Fulda, and betook himself
to the noted high-school at Erfurt.</p>

<p>Among his dearest fellow <i>Alumni</i> here were Rubianus and
Hoff, both of whom subsequently achieved great renown. In the
Augustine convent, near the school, there was residing a poor
young monk, who also subsequently became somewhat famous.
Nobody, however, took much account of him just then, and few
even cared to know his name—Martin Luther. The plague
breaking out at Erfurt, Rubianus was accompanied by Ulrich to
Cologne, there to pursue their studies. The heart and purse of
Ulrich’s father were closed against the son, because of his flight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
from Fulda; but his kinsman Eitelwolf, provided for the necessities
of the rather imprudent young scholar.</p>

<p>The sages who trained the young idea at Cologne were of the
old high and dry quality—hating progress and laboriously learned
in trifles. At the head of them were Hogstraten and Ortuin.
Ulrich learned enough of their manner to be able to crush them
afterward with ridicule, by imitating their style, and reproducing
their gigantic nonsense, in the famous “Epistolæ Obscurorum
Virorum.” In the meantime he knit close friendship with Sebastian
Brandt, and Œcolampadius—both young men of progress.
The latter was expelled from Cologne for being so, but the University
of Frankfort on the Oder offered him an asylum. Thither
Ulrich repaired also, to be near his friend, and to sharpen his
weapons for the coming struggle between light and darkness—Germany
against Rome, and the German language against the
Latin.</p>

<p>At Frankfort he won golden opinions from all sorts of people.
The Elector, Joachim of Brandenburg; his brother, the priestly
Margrave Albert; and Bishop Dietrich von Beilow were proud
of the youth who did honor to the university. He here first became
a poet, and took the brothers Von Osthen for his friends.
He labored earnestly, and acquired much glory; but he was a
very free liver to boot, though he was by no means particularly
so, for the times in which he lived. His excesses, however,
brought on a dangerous disease, which, it is sometimes supposed,
had not hitherto been known in Europe. Be this as it may, he
was never wholly free from the malady as long as he lived, nor
ever thought that it much mattered whether he suffered or not.</p>

<p>He was still ill when he took up for a season the life of a wandering
scholar. He endured all its miserable vicissitudes, suffered
famine and shipwreck, and was glad at last to find a haven, as a
poor student, in the Pomeranian University of Griefswalde. The
Professor Lötz and his father the Burgomaster, were glad to
patronize so renowned a youth, but they did it with such insulting
condescension that the spirit of Ulrich revolted; and in 1509, the
wayward scholar was again a wanderer, with the world before
him where to choose. The Lötzes, who had lent him clothes,
despatched men after him to strip him; and the poor, half-frozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span>
wretch, reached Rostock half starved, more than half naked, with
wounds gaping for vengeance, and with as little sense about him
as could be possessed by a man so ill-conditioned.</p>

<p>He lived by his wits at Rostock. He was unknown and perfectly
destitute; but he penned so spirited a metrical narrative of
his life and sufferings, addressed to the heads of the university
there, that these at once received him under their protection. In
a short time he was installed in comparative comfort, teaching the
classics to young pupils, and experiencing as much enjoyment as
he could, considering that the Lötzes of Griefswalde were continually
assuring his patrons that their protégé was a worthless
impostor.</p>

<p>He took a poet’s revenge, and scourged them in rhymes, the
very ruggedness of which was tantamount to flaying.</p>

<p>Having gained his fill of honor at Rostock, his restless spirit
urged him once again into the world. After much wandering, he
settled for a season at Wittenburg, where he was the delight of
the learned men. By their eleemosynary aid, and that of various
friends, save his father, who rejoiced in his renown but would not
help him to live, he existed after the fashion of many pauper students
of his day. At Wittenburg he wrote his famous “Art of
Poetry;” and he had no sooner raised universal admiration by its
production, than forth he rushed once more into the world.</p>

<p>He wandered through Bohemia and Moravia, thankfully accepting
bread from peasants, and diamond rings from princes.
He had not a maravedi in his purse, nor clean linen on his back;
but he made himself welcome everywhere. One night he slept,
thankfully, on the straw of a barn; and the next sank, well-fed,
into the eider-down of a bishop’s bed. He entered Olmutz
ragged, shoeless, and exhausted. He left it, after enjoying the
rich hospitality he had laughingly extracted from Bishop Turso,
on horseback, with a heavy purse in his belt, a mantle on his
shoulder, and a golden ring, with a jewel set in it, upon his finger.
Such were a student’s vicissitudes, in the days of German wandering,
a long time ago.</p>

<p>The boy, for he was not yet twenty years of age, betook himself
to Vienna, where he kept a wide circle in continual rapture
by the excellence of his poetical productions. These productions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
were not “all for love,” nor were they all didactic. He poured
out war-ballads to encourage the popular feeling in favor of the
Emperor Maximilian, against his enemies in Germany and Italy.
Ulrich was, for the moment, the Tyrtæus of his native country.
Then, suddenly recollecting that his angry sire had said that if
his son would not take the monk’s cowl, his father would be content
to see him assume the lawyer’s coif, our volatile hero hastened
to Pavia, opened the law books on an ominous 1st of April, 1512,
and read them steadily, yet wearied of them heartily, during just
three months.</p>

<p>At this time Francis the first of France, who had seized on
Pavia, was besieged therein by the German and Swiss cavalry.
Ulrich was dangerously ill during the siege, but he occupied the
weary time by writing sharp epitaphs upon himself. The allies
entered the city; and Ulrich straightway departed from it, a
charge having been laid against him of too much partiality for
the French. The indignant German hurried to Bologna, where
he once more addressed himself to the <i>Pandects</i> and the <i>Juris
Codices Gentium</i>.</p>

<p>This light reading so worked on his constitution that fever laid
him low, and after illness came destitution. He wrote exquisite
verses to Cardinal Gurk, the imperial embassador in Bologna,
where the pope for the moment resided; but he failed in his object
of being raised to some office in the cardinal’s household. Poor
Ulrich took the course often followed by men of his impulses and
condition; he entered the army as a private soldier, and began
the ladder which leads to knighthood at the lowest round.</p>

<p>Unutterable miseries he endured in this character; but he went
through the siege of Pavia with honor, and he wrote such sparkling
rhymes in celebration of German triumphs and in ridicule of
Germany’s foes, that, when a weakness in the ankles compelled
him to retire from the army, he collected his songs and dedicated
them to the Emperor.</p>

<p>The dedication, however, was so very independent of tone, that
Maximilian took no notice of the limping knight who had exchanged
the sword for the lyre. Indeed, at this juncture, the man
who could wield a sledge-hammer, was in more esteem with the
constituted authorities than he who skilfully used his pen. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
young poet could scarcely win a smile, even from Albert of Brandenburg,
to whom he had dedicated a poem. Sick at heart, his
health gave way, and a heavy fever sent him to recover it at the
healing springs in the valley of Ems.</p>

<p>A short time previous to his entering the army, the young
Duke Ulrich of Wurtemburg had begun to achieve for himself a
most unenviable reputation. He had entered on his government;
and he governed his people ill, and himself worse. He allowed
nothing to stand between his own illustrious purpose and the
object aimed at. He had for wife the gentle Bavarian princess,
Sabina, and for friend, young Johan von Hutten, a cousin of our
hero Ulrich.</p>

<p>Now, Johan von Hutten had recently married a fair-haired
girl, with the not very euphonious appellation of Von Thumb.
She was, however, of noble birth, and, we must add, of light principles.
The duke fell in love with her, and she with the duke,
and when his friend Johan remonstrated with him, the ducal
sovereign gravely proposed to the outraged husband an exchange
of consorts!</p>

<p>Johan resolved to withdraw from the ducal court; and this resolution
alarmed both his wife and the duke, for Johan had no intention
of leaving his lightsome Von Thumb behind him. Therefore,
the duke invited Johan one fine May morning in the year
1515, to take a friendly ride with him through a wood. The invitation
was accepted, and as Johan was riding along a narrow
path, in front of the duke, the latter passed his sword through the
body of his friend, slaying him on the spot.</p>

<p>Having thus murdered his friend, the duke hung him up by
the neck in his own girdle to a neighboring tree, and he defended
the deed, by giving out that ducal justice had only been
inflicted on a traitor who had endeavored to seduce the Duchess
of Wurtemburg! The lady, however, immediately fled to her
father, denouncing the faithlessness of her unworthy husband, on
whose bosom the young widow of the murdered Johan now reclined
for consolation.</p>

<p>On this compound deed becoming known, all Germany uttered
a unanimous cry of horror. The noblest of the duke’s subjects
flung off their allegiance. His very servants quitted him in disgust.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
His fellow-princes invoked justice against him and Ulrich
von Hutten, from his sick couch at Ems, penned eloquent appeals
to the German nation, to rise and crush the ruthless wretch who
had quenched in blood, the life, the light, the hope, the very flower
of Teutonic chivalry.</p>

<p>The “Philippics” of Ulrich were mainly instrumental in raising
a terrible Nemesis to take vengeance upon his ducal namesake;
and he afterward wrote his “Phalarismus” to show that the tyrant
excited horror, even in the infernal regions. The opening sentence—“Jacta
est alea!” became his motto; and his family took for its
apt device—“Exoriare aliquis nostris ex ossibus ultor!” From
this time forward, Ulrich von Hutten was a public man, and became
one of the foremost heroes of his heroic age. He was now
scholar, poet, and knight.</p>

<p>His fame would have been a pleasant thing to him, but the
pleasure was temporarily diminished by the death of his old benefactor,
Eitelwolf von Stein. The latter was the first German
statesman who was also a great scholar; and <i>his</i> example first
shook the prejudice, that for a knight or nobleman to be book-learned
was derogatory to his chivalry and nobility. Into the
area of public warfare Ulrich now descended, and the enemies of
light trembled before the doughty champion. The collegiate
teachers at Cologne, with Hogstraten, the Inquisitor, Pfefierkorn,
a converted Jew, and Ortuin—at their head, had directed all the
powers of the scholastic prejudices against Reuchlin and his followers,
who had declared, that not only Greek, but Hebrew
should form a portion of the course of study for those destined to
enter the Church. The ancient party pronounced this Heathenism;
Reuchlin and his party called it Reason, and Germany, was
split in two, upon the question.</p>

<p>At the very height of the contest, a lad with a sling and a stone
entered the lists, and so dexterously worked his missiles, that the
enemy of learning was soon overcome. The lad was Von Hutten,
who, as chief author of those amusing satires, “Epistolae
Obscurorum Virorum,” ruined Monkery and paralyzed Rome, by
making all the world laugh at the follies, vices, crimes, and selfish
ignorance of both.</p>

<p>Leo X. was so enraged, that he excommunicated the authors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
and devoted them to damnation. “I care no more,” said Von
Hutten, “for the bull of excommunication than I do for a soap-bubble.”
The reputation he had acquired, helped him to a reconciliation
with his family; but the members thereof had only small
respect for a mere learned knight. They urged him to qualify
himself for a chancellor, and to repair to Rome, and study the law
accordingly.</p>

<p>Something loath, he turned his face toward the Tyber, in 1515.
The first news received of the law-student was to the effect, that
having been attacked, dagger in hand, at a pic-nic, near Viterbo,
by five French noblemen, whom he had reproved for speaking ill
of Germany and the Emperor Maximilian, he had slain one
and put the other four to flight. From this fray he himself escaped
with a slash on the cheek. He recounted his victory in a
song of triumph, and when the law-student sat down to his books,
every one in Rome acknowledged that his sword and his pen were
equally pointed.</p>

<p>His French adversaries threatened vengeance for their humiliating
defeat; and he accordingly avoided it, by withdrawing to
Bologne, where he again, with hearty disgust, applied himself to
the severe study of a law which was never applied for justice sake.
He found compensation in penning such stirring poetry as his satirical
“Nemo,” and in noting the vices of the priesthood with the
intention of turning his observation to subsequent profit. A feud
between the German and Italian students at Bologna soon drove
our scholar from the latter place. He took himself to Ferrara
and Venice; was welcomed everywhere by the learned and liberal,
and, as he wrote to Erasmus, was loaded by them with solid pudding
as well as empty praise.</p>

<p>From this journey he returned to his native country. He repaired
to Augsburg, where Maximilian was holding court, and so
well was he commended to the emperor, that on the 15th of June,
1517, that monarch dubbed him Imperial Knight, placed a gold
ring, symbolic of chivalrous dignity, on his finger, and crowned
him a poet, with a laurel wreath, woven by the fairest flower of
Augsburg, Constance Peutinger.</p>

<p>After such honors, his father received him with joy at his
hearth; and while Von Hutten went from his native Stackelberg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>
to the library at Fulda, yet hesitating whether to take
service under the Emperor or under the Elector of Mayence,
he bethought himself of the irrefutable work of Laurentius
Valla against the temporal authority and possessions of the
Popedom. He studied the work well, published an improved
edition, and dedicated it, in a letter of fire and ability, to Leo X.;—a
proof of his hope in, or of his defiance of, that accomplished
infidel.</p>

<p>Luther and Von Hutten were thus, each unconscious of the
other, attacking Popery on two points, about the same moment.
Luther employed fearful weapons in his cause, and wielded them
manfully. Von Hutten only employed, as yet, a wit which made
all wither where it fell; and an irony which consumed where it
dropped. In the handling of these appliances, there was no man
in Germany who was his equal. Leo could admire and enjoy
both the wit and the irony; and he was not disinclined to agree
with the arguments of which they were made the supports; but
what he relished as a philosopher, he condemned as a Pontiff.
The Florentine, Lorenzo de’ Medici, could have kissed the German
on either cheek, but the Pope, Leo X., solemnly devoted him to
Gehenna.</p>

<p>As a protection against papal wrath, Von Hutten entered the
service of Albert, Elector-Archbishop of Mayence. Albert was
a liberal Romanist, but nothing in the least of an Ultra-Montanist.
He loved learning and learned men, and he recollected that he
was a German before he was a Romanist. In the suite of the
elector, Von Hutten visited Paris, in 1518. He returned to
Mayence only to carry on more vigorously his onslaught against
the begging monks. He accounted them as greater enemies to
Germany than the Turks. “We fight with the latter, beyond our
frontier for power; but the former are the corrupters of science,
of religion, of morals—and they are in the very midst of us.”
So does he write, in a letter to Graf Nuenar, at Cologne.</p>

<p>The building of St. Peter’s cost Rome what the building of
Versailles cost France—a revolution. In each case, an absolute
monarchy was overthrown never again to rise. To provide for
the expenses of St. Peter’s, the Dominican Tetzel traversed Germany,
selling his indulgences. Luther confronted him, and denounced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
his mission, as well as those who sent him on it. Von
Hutten, in his hatred of monks, looked upon this as a mere monkish
squabble; and he was glad to see two of the vocation holding
one another by the throat.</p>

<p>At this precise moment, Germany was excited at the idea of a
projected European expedition against the Turks. The Imperial
Knight saw clearly the perils that threatened Christendom from
that question, and was ready to rush, sword in hand, to meet them.
He declared, however, that Europe groaned under a more insupportable
yoke, laid on by Rome, and he deprecated the idea of
helping Rome with funds against the Moslem. What a change
was here from the Imperial crusading knights of a few centuries
earlier. “If Rome,” he said, “be serious on the subject of such
a crusade, we are ready to fight, but she must pay us for our services.
She shall not have both our money and our blood.” He
spoke, wrote, and published boldly against Rome being permitted
to levy taxes in Germany, on pretence of going to war with the
unbelieving Ottomans. At the same moment, Luther was denouncing
the monks who thought to enrich the coffers of Rome
by the sale of indulgences. One was the political, the other the
religious enemy of the power which sought to rule men and their
consciences from under the shadow of the Colosseum.</p>

<p>There was little hope of aid from the emperor, but Von Hutten
looked for all the help the cause needed in a union of the citizen
classes (whom he had been wont to satirize) with the nobility.
To further the end in view, he wrote his masterly dialogue of
“The Robbers.” In this piece, the speakers are knights and
citizens. Each side blames the other, but each is made acquainted
with the other’s virtues, by the interposition of a <i>Deus ex machinâ</i>
in the presence of the knight, Franz von Sickingen. The whole
partakes of the spirit and raciness of Bunyan and Cobbett.
Throughout the dialogue, the vices of no party in the state find
mercy, while the necessity of the mutual exercise of virtue and
aid is ably expounded.</p>

<p>The knight, Franz von Sickingen, was author of a part of this
dialogue. His adjurations to Von Hutten not to be over-hasty
and his reason why, are no doubt his own. By the production
of such papers, Germany was made eager for the fray. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
particular and powerful dialogue was dedicated to John, Pfalzgraf
of the Rhine, Duke of Bavaria, and Count of Spanheim. This
illustrious personage had requested Ulrich that whenever he published
any particularly bold book, in support of national liberty,
he would dedicate it to him, the duke. The author obeyed, in
this instance, on good grounds and with right good will. There
is in the dialogue an audible call to war, and this pleased Luther
himself, who was now convinced that with the pen alone, the
Reformation could not be an established fact.</p>

<p>Ulrich longed for the contact, whereby to make his country and
his church free of Romanist tyranny. But he considers the possibility
of a failure. He adjured his family to keep aloof from
the strife, that they might not bring ruin on their heads, in the
event of destruction falling on his own. The parents of Ulrich
were now no more; Ulrich as head of his house was possessed
of its modest estates. Of his own possessions he got rid, as of an
encumbrance to his daring and his gigantic activity. He formally
made over nearly all to his next brother, in order that his enemies,
should they ultimately triumph, might have no ground for seizing
them.</p>

<p>At the same time, he warned his brother to send him neither
letters nor money, as either would be considered in the light of
aid offered to an enemy, and might be visited with terrible
penalties.</p>

<p>Having rid himself of what few would so easily have parted
from, he drew his sword joyously and independently for the sake
of liberty alone, and with a determination of never sheathing it
until he had accomplished that at which he aimed, or that the accomplishment
of such end had been placed beyond his power.</p>

<p>“Jacta est alea,” cried he, viewing his bright sword, “the die
is thrown, Ulrich has risked it.”</p>

<p>In the meantime Von Hutten remained in the service of the
Elector-Archbishop of Mayence. The courtiers laughed at him
as a rude knight. The knights ridiculed him as a poor philosopher.
Both were mistaken; he was neither poor nor rude, albeit
a <i>Ritter</i> and a sage. What he most cared for, was opportunity
to be useful in his generation, and leisure enough to cultivate
learning during the hours he might call his own. His satirical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>
poems, coarsely enough worded against a courtier’s life, are admirable
for strength and coloring. Not less admirable for taste
and power are his letters of this period. In them he denounces
that nobility which is composed solely of family pride; and he
denounces, with equally good foundation, the life of “Robber
Knights,” as he calls them, who reside in their castles, amid every
sort of discomfort, and a world of dirt, of hideous noises, and unsavory
smells; and who only leave them to plunder or to be plundered.
He pronounces the true knights of the period to be those
alone who love religion and education. With the aid of these,
applied wisely and widely, and with the help of great men whom
he names, and who share his opinions, he hopes, as he fervently
declares, to see intellect gain more victories than force—to be
able to bid the old barbarous spirit which still influenced too many
“to gird up its loins and be off.” Health came to him with this
determination to devote himself to the service and improvement
of his fellow-men. It came partly by the use of simple remedies,
the chief of which was moderation in all things. Pen and sword
were now alike actively employed. He put aside the former, for
a moment, only to assume the latter, in order to strike in for vengeance
against the aggressive Duke of Wurtemburg.</p>

<p>The crimes of this potentate had at length aroused the emperor
against him. Maximilian had intrusted the leadership of his
army to the famous knight-errant of his day, Franz von Sickingen.
This cavalier had often been in open rebellion against the emperor
himself; and Hutten now enrolled himself among the followers
of Franz. His patron not only gave him the necessary permission
but continued to him his liberal stipend; when the two knights
met, and made their armor clash with their boisterous embrace,
they swore not to stop short of vengeance on the guilty duke, but
to fight to the death for liberty and Christendom. They slept
together in the same bed in token of brotherly knighthood, and
they rose to carry their banner triumphantly against the duke—ending
the campaign by the capture of the metropolis, Stutgardt.</p>

<p>Reuchlin resided in the capital, and the good man was full of
fear; for murder and rapine reigned around him. His fear was
groundless, for Von Hutten had urged Sickingen to give out that
in the sack of Stutgardt, no man should dare to assail the dwelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span>
of Reuchlin. The two knights left the city to proceed to the
spot in the wood where still lay buried the body of the murdered
John von Hutten. “It had lain four years in the grave,” said
Ulrich, “but the features were unchanged. As we touched him,
blood flowed afresh from his wounds; recognise in this the witness
of his innocence.” The corpse was eventually transported to the
family vault at Esslingen.</p>

<p>The cities of the hard-pressed duke fell, one after the other,
and the guilty prince was driven from his inheritance. Von Hutten
remained with the army, busily plying his pen; his sword on
the table before him, his dagger on his hip, and himself encased
in armor to the throat. Erasmus laughingly wrote to him to leave
Mars and stick to the Muses. He scarcely needed this advice,
for his letters from the camp show that fond as he was of the field,
he loved far better the quiet joys of the household hearth. Amid
the brazen clangor of trumpets, the neighing of steeds, the rolling
of the drum, and the boom of battle, he writes to Piscator
(Fischer), his longing for home, and his desire for a wife to smile
on, and care for him; one who would soothe his griefs and share
his labors—“One,” he says, “with whom I might sportively
laugh and feel glad in our existence—who would sweeten the
bitter of life and alleviate the pressure of care. Let me have a
wife, my dear Friederich, and thou knowest how I would love
her ... young, fair, shy, gentle, affectionate, and well-educated.
She may have some fortune, but not excess of it; and as for position,
this is my idea thereon: that <i>she</i> will be noble enough whom
Ulrich von Hutten chooses for his mate.” As a wooer, it will be
seen that the scholar-knight had as little of the faint heart as the
audacious “Findlay” of Burns, and I might almost say of Freiligrath,
so spiritedly has the latter poet translated into German the
pleasant lines of the Ayrshire ploughman.</p>

<p>Well had it been for Ulrich had he found, in 1519, the wife of
his complacent visions. The gentle hand would have saved him
from many a cruel hour.</p>

<p>On his return to Mayence he had well-nigh obeyed the universal
call addressed to him, to join openly with Luther against Rome.
He was withheld by his regard for his liberal patron, the archbishop.
He remained, partly looking on and partly aiding, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>
outskirts of the field where the fray was raging. He published a
superb edition of Livy, and to show that the reforming spirit still
burned brightly in the bosom of the scholar, he also published his
celebrated “Vadiscus, sive Trias Romana.” This triple-edged
weapon still inflicts anguish on Rome. Never had arrow of such
power stricken the harlot before. Its point is still in her side;
and her adversaries knew well how to use it, by painfully turning
it in the wound.</p>

<p>The knight now hung up his sword in his chamber at Stackelberg,
and devoted himself to his pen. In the convent library at
Fulda he discovered an ancient German work against the supremacy
of the Pope over the princes and people of Germany. Of
this he made excellent use. His own productions against Rome
followed one another with great rapidity. Down to the middle of
1520 he was incessantly charging the Vatican, at the point of a
grey goosequill. He had at heart the freeing of Germany from
the ecclesiastical domination of Italy, just as the men of Northern
Italy have it at heart to rescue her from the cruel domination of
Austria.</p>

<p>To accomplish his ends, Von Hutten left no means untried.
Knight and scholar, noble and villain, the very Emperor Charles
V. himself, Ulrich sought to enlist in the great confederacy, by
which he hoped to strike a mortal blow at the temporal power of
the “Universal Bishop.” His books converted even some of the
diocesans of the Romish Church; but Rome thundered excommunication
on the books and their author, and directed a heavy
weight of censure against his protector, Albert of Mayence.</p>

<p>The archbishop admonished Von Hutten, and interdicted his
works. This step decided Ulrich’s course. He at once addressed
his first letter to Luther. It began with the cry of “Freedom for
ever!” and it offered heart, head, soul, body, brains, and purse, in
furtherance of the great cause. He tendered to Luther, in the
name of Sickingen, a secure place of residence; and he established
his first unassailable battery against Rome, by erecting a printing-press
in his own room in the castle of Stackelberg, whence he directed
many a raking fire against all his assailants. “Jacta est
alea!” was his cry; “Let the enemies of light look to it!”</p>

<p>From Fulda he started to the court of the Emperor Charles V.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span>
at Brussels. But his enemies stood between him and the foot of
the throne, and he was not allowed to approach it. His life, too,
was being constantly threatened. He withdrew before these
threats, once more into Germany, taking compensation by the
way, for his disappointment, by a characteristic bit of spirit. He
happened to fall in with Hogstraten, the heretic-finder, and the
arch-enemy of Reuchlin. Ulrich belabored him with a sheathed
sword till every bone in the body of Hogstraten was sore. In return,
the knight was outlawed, and Leo X. haughtily commanded
that hands should be laid upon him wherever he might be found,
and that he should be delivered, gagged, and bound, to the Roman
tribunals.</p>

<p>Franz von Sickingen immediately received him within the safe
shelter of his strong fortress of Ebernberg, where already a score
of renowned theological refugees had found an asylum. The colloquies
of the illustrious fugitives made the old walls ring again.
Von Hutten reduced these colloquies to writing, and I may name,
as one of their conclusions, that the service of the mass in German
was determined on, as the first step toward an established reformation.</p>

<p>The attempt of the Pope to have Ulrich seized and sacrificed,
was eagerly applied by the latter to the benefit of the cause he
loved. To the emperor, to the elector, to the nobles, knights, and
states of Germany, he addressed papers full of patriotism, eloquence,
and wisdom, against the aggression on German liberty.
Throughout Germany this scholar-knight called into life the spirit
of civil and religious freedom, and Luther, looking upon what
Ulrich was doing, exclaimed: “Surely the last day is at hand!”</p>

<p>These two men, united, lit up a flame which can never be trodden
out. One took his Bible and his pen, and with these pricked
Rome into a fury, from which she has never recovered. The
other, ungirding his sword, and transferring his printing-press to
Ebernberg, sent therefrom glowing manifestoes which made a
patriot of every reader.</p>

<p>The lyre and learning were both now employed by Von Hutten,
in furtherance of his project. His popular poetry was now read
or sung at every hearth. Not a village was without a copy, often
to be read by stealth, of his “Complaint and Admonition.” His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span>
dialogues, especially that called the “Warner,” in which the colloquists
are a Roman alarmist and Franz von Sickingen himself,
achieved a similar triumph. It was to give heart to the wavering
that Von Hutten wrote, and sent abroad from his press at Ebernberg,
those remarkable dialogues.</p>

<p>Franz von Sickingen, his great protector, was for a season apprehensive
that Ulrich’s outcry against Rome was louder than
necessary, and his declared resolution to resent oppression by
means of the sword, somewhat profane. Ulrich reasoned with
and read to the gallant knight. His own good sense, and the arguments
of Luther and Ulrich, at length convinced him that it was
folly and sin to maintain outward respect for Rome as long as the
latter aspired to be lord in Germany, above the kaiser himself.
Franz soon agreed with Hutten that they ought not to heed even
the Emperor, if he commanded them to spare the Pope, when
such mercy might be productive of injury to the empire. In such
cases, not to obey was the best obedience. They would not now
look back. “It is better,” so runs it in Von Hutten’s “Warner,”
“to consider what God’s will is, than what may enter the heads
of individuals, capricious men, more especially in the case wherein
the truth of the Gospel is concerned. If it be proved that nothing
satisfactory, by way of encouragement, can come to us from the
Emperor, they who love the Church and civil liberty must be bold
at their own peril, let the issue be what it may.”</p>

<p>The dialogue of the “Warner” was, doubtless, not only read to
Sickingen during the progress of its composition, but was unquestionably
a transcript of much that was talked about, weighed, and
considered between the two friends, as they sat surrounded by a
circle of great scholars and soldiers, for whose blood Rome was
thirsting. It ends with an assurance of the full adhesion of Franz
to the views of Ulrich. “In this matter,” says the “Warner” to
the knight of Ebernberg, “I see you have a passionate and zealous
instigator, a fellow named Von Hutten, who can brook delay with
patience, and who has heaped piles upon piles of stones, ready to
fling them at the first adversary who presents himself.” “Ay,
in good sooth,” is the ready answer of Franz, “and his service is
a joy to me, for he has the true spirit requisite to insure triumph
in such a struggle as ours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span></p>

<p>Thus at Ebernburg the battery was played against the defences
of Rome, while Luther, from his known abodes, or from his concealment
in friendly fortresses, thundered his artillery against the
doctrines and superstitions of Rome. The movement had a
double aspect. The Germans were determined to be free both as
Christians and as citizens. The conducting of such determination
to its successful issue could not be intrusted to worthier or more
capable hands than those of Luther, aided by the Saxon Frederick
the Wise, and Ulrich von Hutten, with such a squire at his
side as hearty Franz von Sickingen.</p>

<p>In 1521 the young emperor, Charles V., delivered a speech at
Worms, which seemed to have been framed expressly to assure
the reformers that the emperor was with them. It abounded in
promises that the kaiser would do his utmost to effect necessary
reforms within the empire. The reformers were in great spirits,
but they soon learned, by the summoning of Luther to Worms,
and by the subsequent conduct of the emperor, that they had nothing
to expect from him which they could thankfully acknowledge.</p>

<p>Ulrich only wrote the more boldly, and agitated the more unceasingly,
in behalf of the cause of which Luther was the great
advocate. To the kaiser himself he addressed many a daring
epistle, as logical as audacious, in order to induce him to shake
off the yoke of Rome, and be master of the Roman world, by
other sanction than that of German election and papal consent.
Von Hutten was more bold and quite as logical in his witheringly
sarcastic epistles addressed to the pope’s legates at Worms. These
epistles show that if at the time there was neither a recognised
liberty of the press nor of individual expression, the times themselves
were so out of joint that men dared do much which their
masters dared not resent.</p>

<p>To the entire body of the priesthood assembled at Worms to
confront Luther, he addressed similar epistles. They abound in
“thoughts that breathe, and words that burn.” In every word
there is defiance. Every sentence is a weapon. Every paragraph
is an engine of war. The writer scatters his deadly missiles
around him, threatening all, wounding many, sometimes indeed
breaking his own head by rash management, but careless of all
such accidents as long as he can reach, terrify, maul, and put to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span>
flight the crowd of enemies who have conspired to suppress both
learning and religion in Germany.</p>

<p>In unison with Sickingen, he earnestly entreated Luther to
repair to Ebernburg rather than to Worms, as there his knightly
friends would protect him from all assailants. The reply of the
great reformer is well known. He would go to Worms, he said,
though there were as many devils as tiles on the roofs, leagued
against him to oppose his journey thither. We can not doubt but
that Luther would have been judicially assassinated in that ancient
city but for the imposing front assumed by his well-armed and
well-organized adherents, who not only crowded into the streets
of Worms, but who announced by placards, even in the very bedchamber
of the emperor, that a thousand lives should pay for the
loss of one hair of the reformer’s head.</p>

<p>Had it depended on Von Hutten, the reformers would not have
waited till violence had been inflicted on Luther, ere they took
their own revenge for wrongs and oppressions done. But he was
overruled, and his hot blood was kept cool by profuse and prosaic
argument on the part of the schoolmen of his faction. He chafed,
but he obeyed. He had more difficulty in reducing to the same
obedience the bands of his adherents who occupied the city and
its vicinity. These thought that the safety of Luther could only
be secured by rescuing him at once from the hands of his enemies.
The scholar-knight thought so too; and he would gladly have
charged against such enemies. He made no signal, however, for
the onslaught; on the contrary he issued orders forbidding it; and
recommended the confederates to sheathe their swords, but yet
to have their hands on the hilt. The elector of Saxony was adverse
to violence, and Luther left Worms in safety, after defying
Rome to her face.</p>

<p>Then came those unquiet times in which Charles V. so warmly
welcomed volunteers to his banner. Seduced by his promises,
Franz von Sickingen, with a few hundreds of strong-sinewed men,
passed over to the Imperial quarters. The old brotherly gathering
at Ebernberg was thus broken up; and Ulrich, who had
offended both pope and emperor by his denunciations of ecclesiastical
and civil tyranny, betook himself to Switzerland, where he
hoped to find a secure asylum, and a welcome from Erasmus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span></p>

<p>This amphibious personage, however, who had already ceased to
laud Luther, affected now a horror against Von Hutten. He wrote
of him as a poor, angry, mangy wretch, who could not be content
to live in a room without a stove, and who was continually pestering
his friends for pecuniary loans. The fiery Ulrich assailed
his false friend in wrathful pamphlets. Erasmus loved the species
of warfare into which such attacks drew or impelled him. He
replied to Ulrich more cleverly than conclusively, in his “Sponge
to wipe out the Aspersions of Von Hutten.” But the enmity of
Erasmus was as nothing compared with the loss of Von Sickingen
himself. In the tumultuary wars of his native land he perished,
and Ulrich felt that, despite some errors, the good cause had lost
an iron-handed and a clear-sighted champion.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that it was at the instigation of Erasmus
that the priestly party in Basle successfully urged the government
authorities to drive Ulrich from the asylum he had temporarily
found there. He quietly departed on issue of the command, and
took his solitary and painful way to Muhlhausen, where a host
of reformers warmly welcomed the tottering skeleton into which
had shrunk the once well-knit man. Here his vigor cast aloft its
last expiring light. Muhlhausen threw off the papal yoke, but
the papist party was strong enough there to raise an insurrection;
and rather than endanger the safety of the town, the persecuted
scholar and soldier once more walked forth to find a shelter. He
reached Zurich in safety. He went at once to the hearth of
Zuinglius, who looked upon the terrible spectre in whom the eyes
alone showed signs of life; and he could hardly believe that the
pope cared for the person, or dreaded the intellect, of so ghostlike
a champion as this.</p>

<p>Ulrich, excommunicated, outlawed and penniless, was in truth
sinking fast. His hand had not strength to enfold the pommel
of his sword. From his unconscious fingers dropped the pen.</p>

<p>“Who will defend me against my calumniators?” asked the yet
willing but now incapable man.</p>

<p>“I will!” said the skilful physician, Otto Brunfels; and the
cooper’s son stoutly protected the good name of Ulrich, after the
latter was at peace in the grave.</p>

<p>The last hours of the worn-out struggler for civil and religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>
liberty, were passed at Ufnau, a small island in the Lake of
Zurich. He had been with difficulty conveyed thither, in the
faint hope that his health might profit by the change. There he
slowly and resignedly died on the last day of August, 1523, and
at the early age of thirty-eight.</p>

<p>A few dearly-loved books and some letters constituted all his
property. He was interred on the island, but no monument has
ever marked the spot where his wornout body was laid down to
repose.</p>

<p>Through life, whether engaged with sword or pen, his absorbing
desire was that his memory might be held dear by his survivors.
He loved activity, abhorred luxury, adored liberty; and, for the
sake of civil and religious freedom, he fought and sang with earnest
alacrity. Lyre on arm, and sword in hand, he sang and
summoned, until hosts gathered round him, and cheered the burthen
of all he uttered. “The die is thrown! I’ve risked it for
truth and freedom’s sake.” Against pope and kaiser, priest and
soldier, he boldly cried, “Slay my frame you may, but my soul is
beyond you!” He was the star that harbingered a bright dawn.
His prevailing enemies drove him from his country; the grave
which they would have denied him, he found in Switzerland, and
“after life’s fitful fever,” the scholar-knight sleeps well in the
island of the Zurich-Zee.</p>

<p>From the Zurich-Zee we will now retrace our steps, and consider
the Sham Knights.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c29">SHAM KNIGHTS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Between</span> Tooting and Wandsworth lies a village of some
celebrity for its sham knights or mayors—the village of Garrat.
The villagers, some century ago, possessed certain common
rights which were threatened with invasion. They accordingly
made choice of an advocate, from among themselves, to protect
their privileges. They succeeded in their object, and as the
selection had been originally made at the period of a general
election, the inhabitants resolved to commemorate the circumstance
by electing a mayor and knighting him at each period of election
for a new parliament. The resolution was warmly approved by
all the publicans in the vicinity, and the Garrat elections became
popular festivities, if not of the highest order, at least of the
jolliest sort.</p>

<p>Not that the ceremony was without its uses. The politicians
and wits of the day saw how the election might be turned to
profit; and Wilkes, and Foote, and Garrick, are especially named
as having written some of the addresses wherein, beneath much
fustian, fun, and exaggeration of both fact and humor, the people
were led to notice, by an Aristophanic process, the defects in the
political system by which the country was then governed. The
publicans, however, and the majority of the people cared more
for the saturnalia than the schooling; and for some years the sham
mayors of Garrat were elected, to the great profit, at least, of the
tavern-keepers.</p>

<p>The poorer and the more deformed the candidate, the greater
his chance of success. Thus, the earliest mayor of whom there
was any record, was Sir John Harper, a fellow of infinite mirth
and deformity, whose ordinary occupation was that of an itinerant
vender of brick-dust. His success gave dignity to the brick-dust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span>
trade, and inspired its members with ambition. They had the
glory of boasting that their friend and brother “Sir John” sat,
when not sufficiently sober to stand, during two parliaments. A
specimen of his ready wit is given in his remark when a dead cat
was flung at him, on the hustings during the period of his first
election. A companion remarked with some disgust upon the
unpleasant odor from the animal. “That’s not to be wondered
at,” said Sir John, “you see it is a pole-cat.”</p>

<p>But Sir John was ousted by an uglier, dirtier, more deformed,
and merrier fellow than himself. The lucky personage in question
was Sir Jeffrey Dunstan. He was a noted individual,
hunched like Esop, and with as many tales, though not always
with the like “morals.” He was a noted dealer in old wigs, for
it was before men had fallen into what was then considered the
disreputable fashion of wearing their own hair, under round hats.
Sir John was a republican; but he did not despise either his office
of mayor or his courtesy title of knight. Had he possessed more
discretion and less zeal, he probably would have prospered in proportion.
In the best, that is, in the quietest, of times, Sir Jeffrey
could with difficulty keep his tongue from wagging. He never
appeared in the streets with his wig-bag on his shoulder, without
a numerous crowd following, whom he delighted with his sallies,
made against men in power, whose weak points were assailable.
The French Revolution broke out when Sir Jeffrey was mayor,
and this gave a loose to his tongue, which ultimately laid him up
by the heels. The knight grew too political, and even seditious,
in his street orations, and he was in consequence committed to
prison, in 1793, for treasonable practices. This only increased
his popularity for a time, but it tamed the spirit of the once
chivalrous mayor. When he ceased to be wittily bold, he ceased
to be cared for by the constituents whose presence made the electors
at Garrat. After being thrice elected he was successfully
opposed and defeated, under a charge of dishonesty. The pure
electors of Garrat could have borne with a political traitor; but
as they politely said, they “could not a-bear a petty larcenist,”
and Sir Jeffrey Dunstan was, metaphorically and actually presented
“with the sack.”</p>

<p>When Manners Sutton ceased to be Speaker, he claimed, I believe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>
to be made a peer; on the plea that it was not becoming
that he who had once occupied the chair, should ever be reduced
to stand upon the floor, of the House of Commons. Sir Jeffrey
Dunstan had something of a similar sense of dignity. Having
fallen from the height of mayor of Garrat, what was then left
for Sir Jeffrey? He got as “drunk as a lord,” was never again
seen sober, and, in 1797, the year following that of his disgrace,
the ex-mayor died of excess. So nice of honor was Sir Jeffrey
Dunstan!</p>

<p>He was succeeded by Sir Harry Dimsdale, the mutilated muffin-seller,
whose tenure of office was only brief, however brilliant,
and who has the melancholy glory of having been the last of the
illustriously dirty line of knighted mayors of Garrat. It was not
that there was any difficulty in procuring candidates, but there
was no longer the same liberality on the part of the peers and
publicans to furnish a purse for them. Originally, the purse was
made up by the inhabitants, for the purpose of protecting their
collective rights. Subsequently, the publicans contributed in
order that the attractions of something like a fair might be added,
and therewith great increase of smoking and drinking. At that
time the peerage did not disdain to patronize the proceeding, and
the day of election was a holyday for thousands. Never before
or since have such multitudes assembled at the well-known place
of gathering; nor the roads been so blocked up by carts and carriages,
honorable members on horses, and dustmen on donkeys.
Hundreds of thousands sometimes assembled, and, through the
perspiring crowd, the candidates, dressed like chimney-sweepers
on May-day, or in the mock fashion of the period, were brought
to the hustings in the carriages of peers, drawn by six horses, the
owners themselves condescending to become their drivers.</p>

<p>The candidate was ready to swear anything, and each elector
was required to make oath, on a brick-bat, “quod rem cum aliquâ
muliere intra limites istius pagi habuissent.” The candidates
figured under mock pseudonyms. Thus, at one election there
were against Sir Jeffrey, Lord Twankum, Squire Blowmedown,
and Squire Gubbings. His lordship was Gardener, the Garrat
grave-digger, and the squires were in humble reality, Willis, a
waterman, and Simmonds, a Southwark publican. An attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
was made to renew the old saturnalia in 1826, when Sir John
Paul Pry offered himself as a candidate, in very bad English, and
with a similarly qualified success. He had not the eloquent power
of the great Sir Jeffrey, who, on presenting himself to the electors
named his “estate in the Isle of Man” as his qualification; announced
his intention of relieving the king in his want of money,
by abolishing its use; engaged to keep his promises as long as it
was his interest to do so, and claimed the favorable influence of
married ladies, on the assurance that he would propose the annulling
of all marriages, which, as he said, with his ordinary logic,
“must greatly increase the influence of the crown, and vastly lower
Indian bonds.” He intimated that his own ambition was limited
to the governorship of Duck Island, or the bishopric of
Durham. The latter appointment was mentioned for the purpose
of enabling the usually shirtless, but for the moment
court-dressed knight, to add that he was “fond of a clean shirt
and lawn-sleeves.” He moreover undertook to show the governors
of India the way which they ought to be going, to Botany
Bay; and to discover the longitude among the Jews of Duke’s
Place.</p>

<p>Courtesy was imperative on all the candidates toward each
other. When Sir Jeffrey Dunstan opposed Sir William Harper,
there were five other candidates, namely—“Sir William Blaze,
of high rank in the army—a corporal in the city train-bands;
Admiral Sir Christopher Dashwood, known to many who has
(<i>sic</i>) felt the weight of his hand on their shoulders, and showing
an execution in the other. Sir William Swallowtail, an eminent
merchant, who supplies most of the gardeners with strawberry
baskets; Sir John Gnawpost, who carries his traffic under his left
arm, and whose general cry is ‘twenty-five if you win and five if
you lose;’ and Sir Thomas Nameless, of reputation unmentionable.”
Sir John Harper was the only knight who forgot chivalrous
courtesy, and who allowed his squire in armor to insult Sir
Jeffrey. But this was not done with impunity. That knight appealed
to usage, compelled his assailant to dismount, drop
his colors, walk six times round the hustings, and humbly ask
pardon.</p>

<p>Sir William Swallowtail, mentioned above, “was one William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span>
Cock, a whimsical basket-maker of Brentford, who, deeming it
proper to have an equipage every way suitable to the honor he
aspired to, built his own carriage, with his own hands, to his own
taste. It was made of wicker work, and was drawn by four, high,
hollow-backed horses, whereon were seated dwarfish boys, whimsically
dressed, for postillions. In allusion to the American War,
two footmen, tarred and feathered, rode before the carriage. The
coachman wore a wicker hat, and Sir William himself, from the
seat of his vehicle, maintained his mock dignity, in grotesque array,
amid unbounded applause.” It should be added that Foote,
who witnessed the humors of the election more than once, brought
Sir Jeffrey upon the stage in the character of <i>Doctor Last</i>; but
the wretched fellow, utterly incapable and awfully alarmed, was
driven from the stage by the hisses of the whole house. Let us
now look abroad for a few “Shams.”</p>

<p>If foreign lands have sent no small number of pseudo-chevaliers
to London, they have also abounded in many by far too patriotic
or prudent to leave their native land. The Hôtel Saint Florentin,
in Paris, was the residence of the Prince Talleyrand, but before
his time it was the stage and the occasional dwelling-place of an
extraordinary actor, known by the appellation of the Chevalier, or
the Count de St. Germain. He was for a time the reigning
wonder of Paris, where his history was told with many variations;
not one true, and all astounding. The popular voice ascribed to
him an Egyptian birth, and attributed to him the power of working
miracles. He could cure the dying, and raise the dead; could
compose magic philters, coin money by an impress of his index
finger; was said to have discovered the philosopher’s stone, and to
be able to make gold and diamonds almost at will. He was, moreover,
as generous as he was great, and his modest breast was
covered with knightly orders, in proof of the gratitude of sovereigns
whom he had obliged. He was supposed to have been
born some centuries back, was the most gigantic and graceful impostor
that ever lived, and exacted implicit faith in his power from
people who had none in the power of God.</p>

<p>The soirées of the Hôtel St. Florentin were the admiration of
all Paris, for there alone, this knight-count of many orders appeared
to charm the visiters and please himself. His prodigality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span>
was enormous, so was his mendacity. He was graceful, witty,
refined, yet not lacking audacity when his story wanted pointing,
and always young, gave himself out for a Methuselah.</p>

<p>The following trait is seriously told of him, and is well substantiated.
“Chevalier,” said a lady to him one night, at a crowded
assembly of the Hôtel St. Florentin, “do you ever remember
having, in the course of your voyages, encountered our Lord Jesus
Christ?” “Yes,” replied the profane impostor, without hesitation
and raising his eyes to heaven. “I have often seen and often
spoken to Him. I have frequently had occasion to admire his
mildness, genius, and charity. He was a celestial being; and I
often prophesied what would befall Him!” The hearers, far from
being shocked, only continued to ply the count with other questions.
“Did you ever meet with the Wandering Jew?” asked a
young marquiss. “Often!” was the reply; and the count added
with an air of disdain:—“that wretched blasphemer once dared
to salute me on the high-road; he was then just setting out on his
tour of the world, and counted his money with one hand in his
pocket, as he passed along.” “Count,” asked a Chevalier de St.
Louis, “who was the composer of that brilliant sonata you played
to-night, on the harpsichord?” “I <i>really</i> can not say. It is a
song of victory, and I heard it executed for the first time on the
day of the triumph of Trajan.” “Will you be indiscreet, dear
count, for once,” asked a newly-married baronne, “and tell us the
names of the three ladies whom you have the most tenderly
loved?” “That is difficult,” said the honest knight with a smile,
“but I think I may say that they were Lucretia, Aspasia, and
Cleopatra.”</p>

<p>The gay world of Paris said he was, at least two thousand
years old; and he did not take the pains to contradict the
report. There is reason to suppose that he was the son of
a Portuguese Jew, who had resided at Bordeaux. His career
was soon ended.</p>

<p>There was a far more respectable chevalier in our own
country to whom the term of Sham Knight can hardly apply;
but as he called himself “Sir John,” and <i>that</i> title was not
admitted in a court of law, some notice of him may be taken
here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span></p>

<p>There was then in the reign of George III., a knight of some
notoriety, whose story is rather a singular one. When Sir John
Gallini is now spoken of, many persons conclude that this once
remarkable individual received the honors of knighthood at the
hands of King George. I have been assured so by very eminent
operatic authorities, who were, nevertheless, completely in error.
Sir John Gallini was a knight of George III.’s time, but he was
so created by a far more exalted individual; in the opinion, at
least, of those who give to popes, who are elective potentates, a
precedence over kings, who are hereditary monarchs. The wonder
is that Gallini was ever knighted at all, seeing that he was simply
an admirable ballet-dancer. But he was the first dancer who
ever received an encore for the dexterous use of his heels. The
Pope accordingly clapped upon them a pair of golden spurs, and
Gallini was, thenceforth, Cavaliere del Sperone d’Oro. Such a
knight may be noticed in this place.</p>

<p>Gallini came to England at a time when that part of the world,
which was included in the term “people of quality,” stood in need
of a little excitement. This was in 1759, when there was the
dullest of courts, with the heaviest of mistresses, and an opera,
duller and heavier than either. Gallini had just subdued Paris
by the magic of his saltatory movements. He thence repaired to
London, with his reputation and slight baggage. He did not announce
his arrival. It was sufficient that Gallini was there. He
had hardly entered his lodgings when he was engaged, on his own
terms. He took the town by storm. His <i>pas seul</i> was pronounced
divine. The “quality” paid him more honor than if he
had invented something useful to his fellow-men. He could not
raise his toe, without the house being hushed into silent admiration.
His <i>entrechats</i> were performed amidst thundering echoes
of delight; his “whirls” elicited shrieks of ecstacy; and when he
suddenly checked himself in the very swiftest of his wild career
and looked at the house with a complacent smile, which seemed
to say—“What do you think of that?” there ensued an explosion
of tumultuous homage, such as the spectators would have <i>not</i>
vouchsafed to the young conqueror of Quebec. Gallini, as far as
opera matters were concerned, was found to be the proper
man in the proper place. For four or five years he was despotic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>
master of the ballet. He was resolved to be master of
something else.</p>

<p>There was then in London a Lady Elizabeth Bertie. Her
father, the Earl of Abingdon, then lately deceased, had, in his
youth, married a Signora Collino, daughter to a “Sir John Collins.”
The latter knight was not English, but of English descent.
His son, Signor Collino, was a celebrated player of the lute in this
country. He was indeed the last celebrated player on that instrument
in England.</p>

<p>Gallini then, the very head of his profession, ranking therein
higher than the Abingdons did in the peerage, was rather condescending
than otherwise, when he looked upon the Earl of Abingdon
as his equal. The earl whom he so considered was the son
of the one who had espoused the Signora Collino, and Lady Elizabeth
Bertie was another child of the same marriage. When
Gallini the dancer, therefore, began to think of proposing for the
hand of that lady, he was merely thinking of marrying the niece
of an instrumental performer. Gallini did not think there was
derogation in this; but he did think, vain, foolish fellow that he
was, that such a union would confer upon him the title of “my
lord.”</p>

<p>Gallini was a gentleman, nevertheless, in his way—that is, both
in manners and morals. Proud indeed he was, as a peacock, and
ambitious as a “climbing-boy,” desirous for ever of being at the
top, as speedily as possible, of every branch of his profession. He
was the “professor of dancing” in the Abingdon family, where his
agreeable person, his ready wit, his amiability, and the modesty
beneath which he hid a world of pretension, rendered him a general
favorite. He was very soon the friend of the house; and long
before he had achieved <i>that</i> rank, he was the very particular friend
of Lady Elizabeth Bertie. She loved her mother’s soft Italian as
Gallini spoke it; and in short she loved the Italian also, language
and speaker. Lady and Signor became one.</p>

<p>When the match became publicly known the “did you evers?”
that reached from box to box and echoed along the passages of
the opera-house were deafening. “A lady of quality marry a
dancer!” Why not, when maids of honor were held by royal
coachmen as being bad company for the said coachman’s sons? It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span>
was a more suitable match than that of a lady of quality with her
father’s footman.</p>

<p>Gallini happened to be in one of the lobbies soon after his marriage,
where it was being loudly discussed by some angry beauties.
In the midst of their ridicule of the bridegroom he approached,
and exclaimed, “Lustrissima, son io! Excellent lady, I am the
man!” “And what does the man call himself?” asked they with
a giggle, and doubtless also with reference to the story of the
bridegroom considering himself a lord by right of his marriage
with a “lady”—“what does the man call himself?” “Eccelenza,”
replied Gallini with a modest bow, “I am Signor Giovanni Gallini,
Esquire.” In the midst of their laughter he turned upon his
heel, and went away to dress in flesh-colored tights, short tunic,
and spangles.</p>

<p>The marriage was not at first an unhappy one. There were
several children, but difficulties also increased much faster than
the family. Not pecuniary difficulties, for Gallini was a prudent
man, but class difficulties. The signor found himself without a
properly-defined position, or what is quite as uneasy probably in
itself, he was above his proper position, without being able to exact
the homage that he thought was due to him. The brother-in-law
of the earl was in the eyes of his own wife, only the dancing-master
of their children. Considering that the lady had condescended to
be their mother, she might have carried the condescension a little
farther, and paid more respect to the father. Dissension arose,
and in a <i>tour de mains</i> family interferences rendered it incurable.
The quarrel was embittered, a separation ensued, and after a tranquil
union of a few years, there were separate households, with
common ill-will in both.</p>

<p>He felt himself no longer a “lord,” even by courtesy, but he resolved
to be what many lords have tried to be, in vain, or who
ruined themselves by being, namely, proprietor and manager of
the opera-house. This was in 1786, by which time he had realized
a fortune by means of much industry, active heels, good looks,
capital benefits, monopoly of teaching, prudence, temperance, and
that economy, which extravagant people call parsimony. This
fortune, or rather a portion of it, he risked in the opera-house—and
lost it all, of course. He commenced his career with as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span>
spirit as if he had only been the steward of another man’s property;
and he made engagements in Italy with such generosity and
patriotism, that the Pope having leisure for a while to turn his
thoughts from divinity to dancing, became as delighted with Gallini
as Pio Nono was with Fanny Cerito. We are bound to believe
that his holiness was in a fit of infallible enthusiasm, when he
dubbed Gallini, Knight of the Golden Spur. The latter returned
to London and wrote himself down “Sir John.” Cards were just
come into fashion, to enable people to pay what were called
“visites en blanc,” and “Sir John Gallini,” was to be seen in
every house where the latter had friend or acquaintance. His
portrait was in all the shops, with this chivalric legend beneath it,
and there are yet to be seen old opera libretti with a frontispiece
exhibiting to an admiring public the effigies of “Sir John Gallini.”</p>

<p>The public liked the sound, liked the man, and sanctioned the
title, by constantly applying it to the individual, without any mental
reserve. They had seen so many fools made knights that they
were glad to see a spirited man make one of himself, by application
of “Sir” to a papally-conferred title. The law, however, no
more allowed it than it did that of the Romanist official who got
presented at court as “Monsignore something,” and whose presentation
was cancelled as soon as the pleasant trick was discovered.
Gallini, however, continued in the uninterrupted title until circumstances
brought him, as a witness, into the presence of Lord Kenyon.
When the Italian opera-dancer announced himself in the
hearing of that judge as Sir John Gallini, the sight of the judge
was what Americans call “a caution.” His lordship looked as
disgusted as Lord Eldon used to do, when he heard an Irish
Romanist Bishop called by a territorial title. As far as the wrath
of Lord Kenyon could do it, metaphorically, the great judge un-sir-John’d
Sir John and chopped off his golden spurs in open
court. Gallini was so good-natured and popular, that the public
opinion would not confirm the opinion of the judge, and Sir John
remained Sir John, in the popular mouth, throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>He was growing rich enough to buy up half the knights in the
country. He built the music-rooms in Hanover Square, for Bach
and Abel’s subscription concerts. That is, he built the house;
and let it out to any who required any portion of it, for any purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>
of music, dancing, exhibiting, lecturing, or any other object
having profit in view. He lodged rather than lived in it himself,
for he had reserved only a small cabinet for his own use, magnificently
sacrificing the rest of the mansion for the use of others,
who paid him liberally for such use. Therewith, Sir John continued
his old profession as teacher as well as performer, manager
at home as well as at the theatre; wary speculator, saving—avaricious,
as they said who failed to cheat him of his money on
faith of illusory promises, with an admirable eye for a bargain,
and admirable care for the result of the bargain after he had
concluded it.</p>

<p>Everything went as merrily with him as it did with Polycrates,
and ill-fortune and he seemed never to be acquainted, till one
fatal night in 1789, the Opera House was burned to the ground,
and the tide that had been so long flowing was now thought to be
on the ebb. Sir John was too heroic to be downcast, and he did
what many a hero would never even have thought of doing, nor,
indeed, any wise man either. He put down thirty thousand
pounds in hard cash toward the rebuilding of the opera-house,
sent to Italy for the best architectural plans, left no means unemployed
to erect a first rate theatre, and worked for that object
with as much integrity as if the safety of the universe depended
on the building of an opera-house in the Haymarket. What the
public lost in one night was thus being made good to them by
another.</p>

<p>Meanwhile fashion was in a deplorable state of musical destitution.
What was to become of London without an opera?
How could the world, the infinitesimal London world, exist without
its usual allowance of roulades and rigadoons? Our knight
was just the champion to come in beneficially at such an extremity.
He opened the little theatre in the Haymarket, and nobody
went to it. Fashion turned up its nose in scorn, and kept away;
nay, it did worse, it acted ungratefully, and when some speculators
established an opera at the Pantheon, Fashion led the way from
the Haymarket, and a host of followers went in her train to
Oxford street. “I will victoriously bring her back to her old
house,” said Sir John. The knight was gallant-hearted, but he
did not know that he had other foes besides Fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span></p>

<p>Sir John got into difficulties through law, lawyers, and false
friends. He ruled as monarch at the opera-house, only to fall,
with ruin. But he was not a man to be dismayed. His courage,
zeal, and industry, were unbounded. He applied all these to
good purpose, and his life was not only a useful but an honorable
and a prosperous one. It ended, after extending beyond the
ordinary allotted time of man, calmly, yet somewhat suddenly;
and “Sir John” Gallini died in his house in Hanover Square,
leaving a large fortune, the memory of some eccentricities, and a
good name and example, to his children. For my part, I can
never enter the ancient concert-rooms in Hanover Square, without
wishing a “Requiescat!” to the knight of the Golden Spur, by
whom the edifice was constructed.</p>

<p>If Sir John Gallini, the dancer, could boast of having been
knighted by a pope, Crescentini, the singer, could boast of having
been knighted by an emperor. He received this honor at the
hands of Napoleon I. He had previously been accustomed to
compliments from, or in presence of, emperors. Thus, in 1804,
at Vienna, he sang the <i>Ombra adorata</i> in the character of Romeo,
with such exquisite grace and tenderness, that, on one occasion,
when he had just finished this admirable lyric piece, the whole
court forming part of his audience, two doves descended from
the clouds, bearing him a crown of laurels, while on every side,
garlands and flowers were flung upon the enchanted and enchanting
warbler. The Austrian Emperor paid him more honor than
his predecessor had ever paid to the Polish king who saved the
empire from the Turks. The reputation of Crescentini gained
for him an invitation, in 1809, to the imperial court of France.
He played in company with Grassini, the two representing
Romeo and Juliet. The characters had never been better represented,
and Talma, who was present, is said to have wept—an
<i>on dit</i> which I do not credit, for there is not only nothing to cry
at in the Italian characters, but Talma himself was in no wise
addicted to indulgence in the melting mood, nor had he even
common courtesy for his own actual Juliet. But the great actor
was pleased, and the great emperor was delighted; so much so,
that he conferred an honor on Crescentini which he would never
grant to Talma—made a chevalier of him. It is true that Talma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span>
desired to be made a knight of the Legion of Honor; but the
emperor would not place on the breast of a tragedian that cross
which was the reward, then, only of men who had played their
parts well, in real and bloody tragedies. The French tragedian
declined the honor that was now accorded to Crescentini, whom
the emperor summoned to his box, and decorated him with the
insignia of the knight of the Iron Crown. The singing chevalier
was in ecstacies. But the Juliet of the night had more cause to
be so, for to her, Napoleon presented a draft on the Treasury, for
20,000 francs. “It will be a nice little dower for one of my
nieces,” said the ever-generous Grassini to one of her friends, on
the following day. Several years after this, a little niece, for
whom she had hitherto done little, came to her, with a contralto
voice, and a request for assistance. After hearing her sing,
Grassini exclaimed, “You have no contralto voice, and need
small help. You will have, with care, one of the finest mezzo-sopranos
in the world. Your throat will be to you a mine of
gold, and you may be both rich and renowned, my dear Giulietta
Grisi.” The niece has excelled the aunt.</p>

<p>Knights of the shire are but sham knights <i>now</i>, and they originally
sprung from a revolutionary movement. Previous to the
reign of Henry III. the people had no voice in the selection of
their legislators. In that king’s reign, however, the legislators
were at loggerheads. Simon de Montfort, the aristocratic head
of a popular party, was opposed to the king; and the great earl
and his friends being fearful of being outvoted in the next parliament,
succeeded in procuring the issue of a writ in the name of
the king, who was then their prisoner, directing the sheriffs of
each county to send two knights, and the authorities in cities and
boroughs to send citizens and burgesses, to represent them in parliament.
This was a fundamental change of a long-established
usage. It was, in fact, a revolution; and the foundation at least
of that form of a constitution on which our present constitutional
substantiality has been erected.</p>

<p>When the king became emancipated, however, although he continued
to summon “barons and great men,” he never during his
reign issued a writ for the election of knights of the shire. His
son, Edward I., summoned the greater and lesser barons, or his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</span>
tenants in chief, according to the old usage. This he did during,
at least, seven years of his reign. The last were not barons, but
they were summoned as “barons’ peers, and all these attended in
their own persons,” and not as representatives of the people. In
the reign of John, indeed, the people’s voice had been heard, but
it may be stated generally, that until the forty-ninth of Henry III.,
the <i>constituent</i> parts of the great council of the nation was composed
solely of the archbishops and bishops, the earls, barons, and
tenants <i>in capite</i>.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact that, in the early elections, the knights of
the shire were elected by universal suffrage; and so, indeed, they
are now, in a certain way, as I shall explain, after citing the following
passage from Hallam’s State of Europe during the Middle
Ages: “Whoever may have been the original voters for county
representatives, the first statute that regulates their election, so far
from limiting the privilege to tenants <i>in capite</i>, appears to place it
upon a very large and democratical foundation. For (as I rather
conceive, though not without much hesitation) not only all freeholders,
but all persons whatever present at the county court, were
declared, or rendered, capable of voting for the knight of their
shire. Such at least seems to be the inference from the expressions
of 7 Henry IV., c. 15, ‘all who are there present, as well suitors
duly summoned for that cause, as others.’ And this acquires some
degree of confirmation from the later statute 8 Henry VI., c. 7,
which, reciting that ‘elections of knights of shires have now, of
late, been made by very great, outrageous, and excessive number
of people dwelling within the same counties, of the which most
were people of small substance and of no value,’ confines the elective
franchise to freeholders of lands or tenements to the value of
forty shillings.”</p>

<p>The original summons to freeholders was, without doubt, by
general proclamation, so that, as Mr. Hallam remarks, “it is not
easy to see what difference there could be between summoned and
unsummoned suitors. And if the words are supposed to glance at
the private summonses to a few friends, by means of which the
sheriffs were accustomed to procure a clandestine election, one can
hardly imagine that such persons would be styled ‘duly summoned.’
It is not unlikely, however,” adds Mr. Hallam, “that these large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
expressions were inadvertently used, and that they led to that inundation
of voters without property which rendered the subsequent
act of Henry VI. necessary. That of Henry IV. had itself been
occasioned by an opposite evil, the close election of knights by a
few persons in the name of the county.”</p>

<p>The same writer proceeds to observe that the consequence of
the statute of Henry IV. was not to let in too many voters, or to
render election tumultuous in the largest of English counties,
whatever it might be in others. Prynne, it appears, published
some singular indentures for the county of York, proceeding from
the sheriffs, during the intervals between the acts of the fourth
and sixth Henry. These “are selected by a few persons calling
themselves the attorneys of some peers and ladies, who, as far as
it appears, had solely returned the knights of that shire. What
degree of weight,” says Mr. Hallam, “these anomalous returns
ought to possess, I leave to the reader.”</p>

<p>I have said that the universal suffrage system in the election of
these knights (and indeed of others) as far as it can be carried
out, in allowing all persons present to have a voice, is still strictly
in force. Appeal is made to the popular assembly as to the choice
of a candidate. The decision is duly announced by the highest
authority present, and then the rejected candidate may, if he thinks
proper, appeal from the people present to those who are legally
qualified to vote. The first ceremony is now a very unnecessary
one, but it is, without doubt, the relic of a time when observation
of it bore therewith a serious meaning.</p>

<p>From parliament to the university is no very wide step. Sir
Hugh Evans and Sir Oliver Martext were individuals who, with
their titles, are very familiar to the most of us. The knightly
title thus given to clergymen, was not so much by way of courtesy,
as for the sake of distinction. It was “worn” by Bachelors of
Arts, otherwise “Domini,” to distinguish them from the Masters
of Arts, or “Magistri.” Properly speaking, the title was a local
one, and ought not to have been used beyond the bounds of the
University: but as now-a-days with the case of “captains” of
packet-boats, they are also captains at home; so, in old times, the
“Sir” of the University was Sir Something Somebody, everywhere.</p>

<p>We laugh at the French for so often describing our knights only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</span>
by their surnames, as “Sir Jones.” This, however, is the old
English form as it was used at Cambridge. The Cambridge “Sirs”
were addressed by Christian and surname in their livings, and in
documents connected therewith. This practice continued till the
title itself was abandoned some time after the Reformation. The
old custom was occasionally revived by the elderly stagers, much
to the astonishment of younger hearers. Thus when Bishop
Mawson of Llandaff was on one occasion at court, he encountered
there a reverend Bachelor of Arts, Fellow of Bene’t College, and
subsequently Dean of Salisbury. His name was Greene. The
bishop, as soon as he saw the “bachelor” enter the drawing-room,
accosted him loudly in this manner: “How do you do, Sir
Greene? When did you leave college, Sir Greene?” <i>Mr.</i>
Greene observing the astonishment of those around him, took
upon himself to explain that the bishop was only using an obsolete
formula of bygone times. The most recent courtesy title
that I can remember, was one given to a blind beggar who was
very well known in the vicinity of Trinity College, Dublin, where,
indeed, he had been a student some five-and-thirty years ago.
He was invariably styled “Domine John,” and he could return a
suitable answer in good Latin, to the query, <i>Quo modo vales?</i>—or
to any other query.</p>

<p>“<i>Vale!</i>” is indeed what I ought to utter to the courteous reader;
nor will I detain him longer—supposing he has kindly borne with
me thus far—than with one brief chapter more, which, being miscellaneous,
I may not inaptly call “Pieces of Armor.”</p>
<hr class="full x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c30">PIECES OF ARMOR.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> word Pieces reminds me of a curious theatrical illustration
of Macedonian chivalry. When Barry used to play Alexander
the Great, he made a grand spectacle of his chariot entry. But
it was highly absurd, nevertheless. When he descended from the
vehicle, his attendant knights, bareheaded and unarmed, placed
their hands upon it, and in an instant it went to pieces, like a
trick in a pantomime, and left in every warrior’s possession,
swords, javelins, shields, and helmets, supplied by the spokes of
the wheels, the poles, the body of the car and its ornaments. This
feat was very highly applauded by our intellectual sires.</p>

<p>This act, however, was hardly more unnatural than the sayings
of some real chevaliers, particularly those of Spain.</p>

<p>Among the Spanish Rhodomontades chronicled by Brantome,
we find none that have not reference to personal valor. There
is the choleric swordsman who walks the street without his weapon,
for the good reason that his hand is so ready to fly to his
sword, if the wind but blow on him too roughly, he is never able
to walk out armed without taking two or three lives. “I will
hoist you so high,” says another Spanish cavalier to his antagonist,
“that you will die before you can reach the earth again.” It
was a fellow of the same kidney who used not only to decapitate
dozens of Moorish heads every morning, but was wont afterward
to fling them so high into the air, that they were half-devoured by
flies before they came down again. Another, boasting of his feats
in a naval battle, quietly remarked, that making a thrust downward
with his sword, it passed through the sea, penetrated the
infernal region, and sliced off a portion of the moustache of Pluto!
“If that man be a friend of yours,” said a cavalier to a companion,
referring at the same time to a swordsman with whom the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
cavalier had had angry words, “pray for his soul, for he has quarrelled
with me.” The self-complacency also of the following is
not amiss. A Spanish captain in Paris, saw the haughty chevalier
d’Ambres pass by him. “Is he,” said the Spaniard, “as valiant
as he is proud?” The reply was in the affirmative. “Then,”
remarked the Iberian, “he is almost as good a man as myself.”
We hear of another, less gallant, perhaps, than brave, who made
it a great favor to ladies when he put off a combat at their request,
and passed a pleasant hour with them, in place of knocking out
brains upon the field. It was a knight of similar notions who cudgelled
his page for boasting of the knight’s valor. “If thou dost
such foolish things, Sir Knave,” said the doughty gentleman, “the
whole female sex will perish of love for me, and I shall have no
leisure left to take towns and rout armies.” This was a full-developed
knight. It was probably his youthful squire who remarked,
when some one expressed surprise that one so young had mustaches
of such unusual length. “They sprung up,” said the
young soldier, “under the smoke of cannon; they grew thus quickly
under the same influences.”</p>

<p>Some of the old Spanish cavaliers used to maintain that their
very beauty dazzled their enemies. However this may have
been, it is a fact that the beauty of Galeozo Maria, Duke of Milan,
was sufficiently striking to save him for a while, against the daggers
of conspirators. One of these, named Lampugnano, longed
to slay him, but did not dare. He was, nevertheless, resolved;
and he employed a singular means for giving himself courage.
He procured a faithful portrait of the handsome duke, and every
time he passed it, he looked steadfastly at the brilliant eyes, and
graceful features, and then plunged his dagger into the canvass.
He continued this practice until he found himself enabled to look
the living duke in the face without being dazzled by his beauty;
and this done, he dealt his blow steadily, and destroyed his great
and graceful foe.</p>

<p>It has often been asserted that there have been few cavaliers
who have carried on war with more indifference and cruelty than
the Spanish knights. But war in all times and in all ages has induced
the first, at least, if not the last. I may cite among what
may be called the more recent instances, one that would hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span>
have occurred, even at Sebastopol. It is in reference to Schomberg’s
army at Dundalk. “The survivors,” says Leland, “used the
bodies of their dead comrades for seats or shelter; and when these
were carried to interment, murmured at being deprived of their
conveniences.” While touching upon Irish matters, I will avail
myself of the opportunity to notice that Irish knights were sometimes
called “iron knee,” “eagle knee,” and “black knee,” from
the armor which was especially needed for that part of the body,
the Irish with their dreadful battle-axes making the sorest stroke
on the thigh of the horseman. The Irish appellation of the White
Knight, was given to the heir of a family wherein gray hairs were
hereditary. The Irish knights, it may be observed, were generally
more religious than the Spanish. The latter were too ready
to ascribe every success to their own might, and not to a greater
hand. Even in the case of St. Lawrence, calmly roasting to death
on his gridiron, the proud Spaniards would not have this patience
ascribed to the grace of God, but only to the true Spanish valor.
While speaking of the burning of St. Lawrence, I will add that
St. Pierre quotes Plutarch in stating, that when the Roman burners
had to reduce to ashes the bodies of several knights and ladies,
they used to place one female body among eight or ten males,
fancying that with this amalgamation they would burn better.
The author of the “Harmonies of Nature” makes upon this the
truly characteristic comment, that the Roman fashion was founded
on the notion, that “the fire of love still burned within us after
death.”</p>

<p>Reverting, for a moment, to the Spaniards, I may notice a
fashion among them which is worth mentioning. When a Spanish
cavalier entered the presence of a Spanish queen, accompanied by
his lady, he did not unbonnet to his sovereign. He was supposed
to be so engrossed by his mistress as to forget even the courtesies
of loyalty.</p>

<p>Brantome, on the other hand, notices kingly courtesy toward a
subject. When describing the battle-acts of the famous M. de
Thorannes, he states that the King in acknowledgment that the
battle of Rentz had been gained chiefly through his courage, took
the collar of his own order from his neck, and placed it on that of
the gallant soldier. This was a most unusual act, according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>
the showing of Brantome, but probably not the first time of a similar
occurrence. The author just named complains in piteous
terms that, in his time and previously, the honors of chivalry had
been bestowed for anything but knightly deeds. They were gained
by favor, influence, or money. Some set their wives to exert their
fascination over the Christian sovereign, and purchase the honor
at any cost. M. de Chateaubriand gave a house and an estate for
the order of St. Michael. Ultimately, it was conferred on single
captains of infantry, to the great disgust of the better-born gentlemen
who had paid dearly for the honor. Brantome declares that
he knew many who had never been half a dozen leagues from
their houses, who wore the insignia of the order, and who talked
of the taking of Loches, as if they had really been present. He
angrily adds, that even lawyers were made knights, stripping
themselves of their gowns, and clapping swords on their thighs.
He appears especially annoyed that the celebrated Montaigne
should have followed a similar example: and he adds with a
malicious exultation, that the sword did not become him half so
well as the pen.</p>

<p>One French Marquis was persecuted by his neighbors to get
orders for them, as if they were applying for orders for the theatre.
He obtained them with such facility, that he even made a knight
of his house-steward, and forced the poor man to go to market in
his collar, to the infinite wounding of his modesty. It was, however,
one rule of the order that the collar should never, under any
pretence whatever, be taken from the neck. The Court had very
unsavory names for these mushroom-knights; and Brantome gives
us some idea of the aristocratic feeling when he recounts, with a
horror he does not seek to disguise, that the order was sold to an
old Huguenot gentleman, for the small sum of five hundred crowns.
A cheap bargain for the new knight, seeing that membership in
the order carried with it exemption from taxation. Luckily for
the Huguenot he died just in time to save himself from being disgraced.
Some gentlemanly ruffians had agreed to attack this
“homme de peu,” as Brantome calls him, to pull the order from
his neck, to give him a cudgelling, and to threaten him with another,
whenever he dared to wear the knightly insignia.</p>

<p>Brantome wonders the more at what he calls the abuse of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>
order as it had been instituted by Louis XI., on the ground that
the old order of the Star founded by King John, in memory of
the star which guided the Kings to the Cradle of Divinity, had
become so common, that the silver star of the order was to be
seen in the hat and on the mantle of half the men in France.
Louis XI., in abolishing the order, conferred its insignia as an ornament
of dress, upon the Chevaliers de Guet, or gentlemen of
the watch, who looked to the safety of Paris when the stars were
shining, or that it was the hour for them to do so. It was an understood
thing with all these orders that if a knight went into the
service of an enemy to the sovereign head of the order, the knight
was bound to divest himself of the insignia and transmit the same
directly to the King.</p>

<p>Before the dignity of the order was humbled, the members took
pride in displaying it even in battle; although they were put to
high ransom, if captured. Some prudent knights, of as much discretion
as valor, would occasionally conceal the insignia before
going into fight; but they were mercilessly ridiculed, when the
absence of the decoration testified to the presence of their discretion.
In the earlier years of its formation, a man could with more
facility obtain a nomination to be captain of the body-guard than
the collar of the order of St. Michael. Louis XI. himself showed
a wise reluctance to making the order common, and although he
fixed the number of knights at six-and-thirty, he would only, at
first, appoint fifteen. Under succeeding kings the order swelled to
limitless numbers, until at last, no one would accept it, even when
forced upon them. One great personage, indeed, sought and obtained
it. He was severely rallied for his bad ambition; but as
he remarked, the emblems of the order would look well, engraved
upon his plate, and the embroidered mantle would make an admirable
covering for his mule.</p>

<p>This sort of satire upon chivalry reminds me that a knight could
unknight himself, when so inclined. An instance occurs in a case
connected with Jeanne Darc. The chevaliers of the Dauphin’s
army had no belief in the inspiration of the Maid of Orleans, until
success crowned her early efforts. The female knight, if one may
so speak, on the other hand, had no measure whatever of respect,
either for knight or friar, who appeared to doubt her heavenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span>
mission. I may just notice, by the way, that a “board” of seven
theologians assembled to consider her claims, and examine the
maiden herself. One of the members, a “brother Seguin,” a
Limousin, who spoke with the strong and disagreeable accent of
his birthplace, asked Jeanne in what sort of idiom she had been
addressed by the divine voice, by which she professed to be guided:
“In a much better idiom than you use yourself,” answered the
pert young lady, “or I should have put no trust in it.” Here, by
the way, we have, perhaps, the origin of the old story of the stammering
gentleman who asked the boy if his m—m—magpie could
speak? “Better than you,” said the boy, “or I would wring his
neck off.” But to resume. Jeanne was quite as <i>nonchalante</i> to
the knights, as she was flippant to the friars. She expressly exhibits
this characteristic, in the first council held in her presence
within Orleans, when she urged immediate offensive measures,
contrary to the opinion of the knights themselves. One of the
latter, the Sire de Gamache, was so chafed by the pertinacity of
the Pucelle, that, at last, springing to his feet, he exclaimed:—“Since
noble princes listen for a moment to the nonsense of a low-bred
hussy like this, rather than to the arguments of a chevalier
such as I am, I will not trouble myself to give any more opinions.
In proper time and place, my good sword will speak, and perchance
I may prevail; but the king and my honor so will it.
Henceforward, I furl and pull down my banner; from this moment
I am only a simple ’squire; but I would much rather have a noble
man for master, than serve under a wench who, perhaps, has been
a—one really does not know what!” and with these words, he
rolled up his banner, placed the same in the hands of Dunois, and
walked out of the tent, not Sir John de Gamache, but plain John
Gamache, Esquire.</p>

<p>A curious result followed. The first attack on the bastion of
Tourelles failed, and Jeanne was slightly wounded and unhorsed.
Gamache was near, and he dismounted and offered her his steed.
“Jump up,” cried the good fellow, “you are a gallant lass, and I
was wrong in calling you ugly names. I will serve and obey you
right willingly.” “And you,” said Jeanne, “are as hearty a
knight as ever thwacked men or helped a maid.” And so were
they reconciled, and remained good friends to the end;—which
was not long in coming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span></p>

<p>Knights, irregularly made so, were unknighted with little ceremony.
Although each duly dubbed knight could confer the same
honor on any deserving such distinction, it was necessary that the
individual about to be so honored should be a gentleman. In
France, if this rule was infringed, the unlucky knight had his
spurs hacked off, on a dunghill. Occasionally the unknighted
person was fined. It may be observed, however, that the king
might make a knight of a villain, if the sovereign were so minded.
That is, a king could raise any of his own subjects to the rank, if
he thought proper. Not so with sovereigns and persons not their
subjects. The Emperor Sigismund, for instance, when visiting
Paris, in 1415, knighted a person who was below the rank of
gentleman. The French people were indignant at this, as an act
of sovereignty in another monarch’s dominions. If this chevalier
was not unknighted, the reason, probably, was that the Emperor
might not be offended. It is said, that in Naples it has never
been necessary for a man to be noble, a gentleman in fact, in order
to be a knight. This may readily be credited. In Naples the
fact of a man being a brute beast does not incapacitate him from
exercising the office even of a king.</p>

<p>After all, there appears to have been some uncertainty in the
observance of the law on the subject. In England the custom
which allowed knights to dub other knights, very soon fell into
disuse, so that there are fewer examples of unknighting in this
country than in France, where the custom prevailed down to the
middle of the sixteenth century; and its abuses, of course, rendered
the unmaking of illegally constituted knights, if not common,
at least an occasional occurrence. Henry III., as I have said in
another page, summoned tenants <i>in capite</i> to receive knighthood
from himself, and authorized tenants of mesne lords to receive the
honor from whom they pleased. But there must have been considerable
disrating of these last distinguished persons, or such an
abuse of creation, so to speak, that the privilege was stopped,
except by special permission of the king. Some places, in
France, however, declared that they held a prescriptive right
for burgesses to receive knighthood at the hands of noblemen,
without the royal permission. Hallam, quoting Villaret, says
that burgesses, in the great commercial towns, were considered as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span>
of a superior class to the roturiers, and possessed a kind of demi-nobility.</p>

<p>Ridiculous as modern knights, whether of town or country,
have been made upon the stage, it is indisputable that in some
cases the ridicule has not been what painters call “loaded,” and
the reality was in itself a caricature. I have read somewhere of
one city gentleman, who was knighted during his shrievalty, and
who forthwith emancipated himself a little from business, and
aired his chivalrous “sir” in gay company. He was once, however,
sorely puzzled on receiving a note of invitation from a lady
whose soirées were the especial delight of her guests, and whose
note ended with the initials, so absurdly placed at the termination
of an invitation in English. R. S. V. P., “réponse, s’il vous
plait.” The newly-coined knight, after allusions to the pressure
of business, accepted the hospitality offered him through the note,
remarking at the same time, that “all work and no play made
Jack a dull boy,” and that he knew nothing more to his taste, after
a long day’s application, than what her ladyship’s note appeared to
present to him in the initials at its foot; namely, a Regular Small
Vist Party. If this anecdote be not apocryphal, I suspect that
the knight’s remark may have sprung less from ignorance than
humor, and that his reading of the initials was meant as a censure
upon an absurd fashion.</p>

<p>While speaking of city knights at home, and their humor, I
will avail myself of the opportunity to give an instance of wit in
a poor chevalier of the city of Paris, whose whole wealth consisted
of a few unproductive acres near the capital, and whose son
had just married a wealthy heiress of very low degree. “Il fait
bien,” said the old knight, “il fume mes terres!”</p>

<p>This was hardly courteous; but elevated courtesy was never
wanting among true knights, in the very rudest of times.</p>

<p>Strange contrasts of feeling were sometimes exhibited. Thus,
when the English were besieging Orleans, they grew suddenly
tired of their bloody work, on Christmas-day, and asked for a
truce while they ate their pudding. The request was not only
readily granted, but the French knights, hearing that the day was
dull in the English camp, obtained the permission of the bastard
Dunois, to send over some musicians to enliven the melancholy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span>
leaguers. The band played lustily during the whole period of the
truce, but the last notes had scarcely ceased, and the “Godons”
as Jeanne Darc rather corruptively called our great sires, who
were too much addicted to swearing, had hardly ceased uttering
their thanks for the musical entertainment, when their cannonade
was renewed by the besiegers with such vigor, that the French
knights swore—harmony had never before been paid in such
hard coin.</p>

<p>There was little ill-feeling consequent upon this. The pages
in either army were allowed to amuse themselves by slaying each
other in a two days’ duel, presided over by the respective generals-in-chief.
This was chivalrous proof that neither party bore malice,
and they beat out each other’s brains on the occasion, in testimony
of universal good-will, with as much delighted feeling as if they
had all been Irishmen. A further proof of absence of individual
rancor may be seen in the fact, that Suffolk sent a gift of pigs,
dates, and raisins, for the <i>dessert</i> of Dunois; and the latter acknowledged
the present by forwarding to the English general some
fur for his robe—Suffolk having complained bitterly of the cold
of that memorable February, 1429.</p>

<p>This reminds me of a similar interchange of courtesy between
French and English antagonists, in later times. When brave
Elliot was defending Gibraltar from gallant Crillon, the former,
who never ate meat, suffered greatly (as did his scurvy-stricken
men) from a scarcity of vegetables. Crillon had more than he
wanted, and he sent of his superabundance, most liberally, to the
foe whom he respected. A whole cart-load of carrots and compliments
made general and garrison glad, and Elliot was as profuse
in his gratitude as he was bound to be. It may be remembered
that similar exchanges of courtesy and creature-comforts took
place at Sebastopol. Sir Edmund Lyons sent Admiral Nachimoff
a fat buck, a gift which the large-minded hero of the
Sinope butchery repaid by a hard Dutch cheese. It may be
said too that the buck would have been more appropriately
sent to the half-starved English heroes who were rotting in the
trenches.</p>

<p>There were some other naval knights of old, touching whom I
may here say a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span></p>

<p>The history of the sea-kings or sea-knights, whose noble vocation
it was to descend from the north with little but ballast in the
holds of their vessels, and to return thither heavily laden with
plunder and glory, is tolerably well known to the majority of
readers. The story of the Flemish pirates, who, nearly eight
centuries ago, carried terror to, and brought spoil from the Mediterranean,
is far less familiar. This story is well illustrated in the
“Biographie des hommes remarquables de la Flandres Occidentale,”
of whom the authors are M. Octave Delepierre, the accomplished
Belgian consul in this country, and Mr. Carton.</p>

<p>The period is a warm June evening of the year 1097. Off the
coast of Cilicia, two large vessels, belonging to the Emperor
Alexis Comnenus, and manned by Constantinopolitan Greeks,
were surrounded and attacked by ten fast-sailing but small vessels,
belonging to the dreaded “Greek Pirates,” whose name alone
brought terror with the sound. On the prow of each light bark
was a rudely sculptured figure of a lion; from the summit of the
tall mast was displayed a green pennant, which was never hauled
down, for the good reason that the pirates never attacked but where
success seemed certain; and if defeat menaced them they could
easily find safety in flight.</p>

<p>There was scarcely a place on the coast which they had not,
for ten years past, visited; and many merchants purchased exemption
from attack by paying a species of very liberal black
mail. It was beneath the dignity of an emperor to buy safety
from piratical rovers, and they had little respect for his vessels, in
consequence.</p>

<p>M. Delepierre informs us that these Flemish pirates had been,
originally, merchants, but that they thought it more profitable to
steal than to barter; and found “skimming the seas,” as the phrase
went, far more lucrative than living by the dull precepts of trade.
Their three principal chiefs were Zegher of Bruges, Gheraert of
Courtrai, and Wimer (whose name still lives in Wimereux) of
Boulogne. The force they had under them amounted to four
hundred intrepid men, who were at once sailors and soldiers, and
who are described as being so skilful that they could with one
hand steer the ship, and with the other wield the boarding-hatchet.
It will be seen that our Laureate’s exhortation to knavish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</span>
tradesmen to lay down their weights and their measures, and to
mend their ways by taking to the vocation of arms, had here a
practical illustration. In the present case, M. Delepierre suggests
that the pirates were, probably, not less honest men than the
Greeks. The latter were ostensibly on their way to succor the
Crusaders, but Alexis was a double dealer, and occasionally despatched
forces against the infidel, which forces turned aside to assault
those Christian neighbors of his, who were too powerful to
be pleasant in such a vicinity, and to get rid of whom was to be
devoutly desired, and, at any cost, accomplished. The foreign
policy of Alexis was as villanously void of principle as that
of any government under a more advanced period of Christian
civilization.</p>

<p>The Greek crews had been summoned to surrender. Gheraert
of Courtrai had called to them to that effect through his leathern
speaking-trumpet. He probably knew little of Greek, and the
Orientals could not have comprehended his Flemish. We may
conclude that his summons was in a macaronic sort of style; in
which two languages were used to convey one idea. The Hellenes
replied to it, however it may have sounded, by hurling at the
Flemings a very hurricane of stones.</p>

<p>The stout men from Flanders were not long in answering in
their turn. “They put into play,” says M. Delepierre, “their
mechanical slings. These were large baskets full of stones
fastened to the end of an elevated balance, the motion of which
flung them to some distance. They had other means of destruction,
in enormous engines, which hurled beams covered with iron,
and monster arrows wrapped in flaming rosin. With scythe-blades
attached to long poles, they severed the ropes and destroyed the
sails, and then flinging out their grapnels they made off with
their prize.”</p>

<p>To this point the present battle had not yet come. It had
lasted an hour, the Greeks had suffered most by the means of
attack above noticed; and they had inflicted but trifling injury,
comparatively, upon the men of the green pennant. They refused,
however, to surrender, but prepared to fly. Wimer saw
the preparatory movement, and, in a loud voice, exclaimed:—“A
dozen divers!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</span></p>

<p>Twelve men, quitting their posts, leaped over the side of the
boat, carrying enormous <i>tarières</i> (augers) with them. They disappeared
beneath the waves; appeared for a moment or two again
above the surface, in order to draw breath; once more plunged
downward; and, finally, at the end of ten minutes, climbed again
into their small vessel, exclaiming, “Master, it is done!”</p>

<p>The twelve divers had established twelve formidable leaks in
the larger of the two Greek vessels, and as it began to sink, the
crew agreed to surrender. The Green Pirates seized all that
was on board that and the other ship. In the latter, stripped of
everything of value, they allowed the two Greek crews to sail
away; and then proceeded toward the coast with their booty, consisting
of rich stuffs, provisions and arms. There was far more
than they needed for their own wants; and so, for the nonce, they
turned traders again. They sold at a good price what they had
unscrupulously stolen, and the profits realized by the Flemish rovers
were enough to make all honest, but poor traders, desire to
turn corsairs.</p>

<p>Zegher ascended the Cydnus, in order to pay a professional
visit to Tarsis, and was not a little surprised, on approaching the
city, to see formidable preparations made to resist him. On drawing
closer, however, the pirate-leader found that Tarsis was in possession
of the army of Flemish crusaders under the great Count
Baldwin; and each party welcomed the other with joyous shouts
of “Long live Flanders!” “Long live the Lion!” The arrival
of the fleet was of the greatest advantage to the Flemings,
who, though they had suffered less than the French, Italian,
and German legions, by whom they had been preceded, and
had been progressively triumphing since they had landed, needed
succors both of men and material, and lo! here were the
Green Pirates ready to furnish both, for a consideration. There
was abundance of feasting that night, and a very heavy sermon in
the morning.</p>

<p>Baldwin was himself the preacher. His style was a mixture
of exhorting with the threatening; and he was so little complimentary
as to tell the Green pirates that they were nothing better
than brigands, and were undoubtedly on their way to the devil.
He added that he would have treated them as people of such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</span>
character, going such a way, only that they were his countrymen.
And then he wept at the very thought of their present demerits,
and their possible destiny. This practice of weeping was inherited
by knights from the old Greek heroes, and a chevalier in complete
steel might shed tears till his suit was rusty, without the
slightest shame. The exhortation continued without appearing to
make any sensible impression upon the rovers. Baldwin, however,
pointed his address at the end, with an observation that if
they would join him in his career of arms, he would give them
lands that should make lords of the whole of them. Upon this
observation the Green Pirates, with a little modest allusion to their
unworthiness, declared that they were eager, one and all, to turn
crusaders.</p>

<p>Each man attached a small green cross, in cloth, to the top
of his sleeve; and joyfully followed Baldwin to the field. The
count was no more able to keep his word than a recruiting
sergeant who promises a recruit that he shall be made a field-marshal.
Nor was he to blame, for the greater part of his new
allies perished; but enough were left to make a score of very
doughty knights.</p>

<p>Admirable sailors were the Northmen, especially the Anglo-Normans,
whether with respect to manœuvring or courage.
“Close quarters” formed the condition on which they liked to be
with an enemy. “Grapple and board” was their system as soon
as they had created a little confusion among the enemy with
their cross-bows and slings. The “mariners” in those days
fought in armor, with heavy swords, spears, and battle-axes.
They were well furnished too with bags of quick-lime, the
contents of which they flung into the eyes of their adversaries,
when they could get to windward of them, an end which they
always had in view.</p>

<p>The first regular naval battle fought between the English and
the French was conducted by the former after the fashion above
mentioned. It was during the reign of Henry III., when Louis
of France, by the destruction of his army at “the fair of Lincoln,”
was shut up in London, and depended on the exertions of his
wife, Blanche of Castile, for his release. Blanche sent eighty
large ships, besides many smaller vessels, from Calais, under a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</span>
piratical commander, the celebrated Eustace Le Moine. Hubert
de Burgh had only forty vessels wherewith to proceed against this
overwhelming force; and on board of these the English knights
proceeded, under protest and with a world of grumbling, at being
compelled to fight on the waters when they had no sea-legs, and
were accustomed to no battles but those on land. No heed was
taken of protest or grumbling; the forty vessels were loosened
from their moorings, and away went the reluctant but strong-boned
land sailors, all in shirts of mail in place of Guernsey jackets,
to contend for the first time with a French fleet. The English
ships contrived to get between Calais and the enemy’s vessels, and
fell upon the latter in their rear. The English bowmen handled
their favorite weapons with a deadly dexterity; and as soon as
their vessels were made fast to those of the French, out flew the
quick-lime, flung by the English, and carried by the wind into the
faces of the French. While these were stamping with pain,
screwing their eyes up to look through the lime-dust, or turning
their backs to avoid it, the English boarders made a rush, cut
down men, hacked away the rigging, and so utterly defeated the
French, unaccustomed to this sort of fighting, that of the great
French fleet only fifteen vessels escaped. The number of Gallic
knights and inferior officers captured was very large. As for
Eustace le Moine, he had slunk below to avoid the lime-powder
and battle-axes. He was seized by Richard Fitzroy, King John’s
illegitimate son. Fitzroy refused to give the recreant quarter, but
hewed off his head on the taffrail, and sent it from town to town
through England as a pleasant exhibition.</p>

<p>Errant knights in quest of adventure, and anxious to secure renown,
less frequently visited England than other countries. They
appear to have had a mortal dislike of the sea. This dislike was
common to the bravest and greatest among them. I may cite, as
an instance, the case of the Duke of Orleans and his cavaliers,
captured at Agincourt, and brought over to England, from Calais
to Dover, by the gallant and lucky Henry. The latter walked
the deck during a heavy ground swell, with as much enjoyment as
though he had been to the matter born. The French prince and
his knights, on the other hand, were as ignorant of the sea and as
uneasy upon it as a modern English Lord of the Admiralty. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</span>
suffered horribly, and one and all declared that they would rather
be daily exposed to the peril of battle, than cross the straits of
Dover once a month.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, stray knights did occasionally brave the dangers
of the deep, and step ashore on the coast of Kent with a challenge
to all comers of equal degree. We have an instance of this sort
of adventurer in Jacques de Lelaing, whose story is told in this
volume. We hear of another in the nameless knight of Aragon,
who in the reign of Henry V. set all London and many a provincial
baronial hall in commotion by his published invitation to all
knights of the same rank as himself, to come and give him a taste
of their quality in a bout at two-edged sword, axe, and dagger.</p>

<p>The challenge was promptly accepted by stout Sir Robert Cary.
Sir Robert was a poor knight, with nothing to lose, for his sire
had lost all he possessed before Sir Robert’s time, by being faithful
to poor Richard II., a virtue, for the exercise of which he was
punished by forfeiture of his estates, decreed against him by Henry
IV. The disinherited knight, therefore, had a chance of winning
land as well as honor, should he subdue the arrogant Aragonese.
The two met in the then fashionable district of Smithfield, and the
Devonshire swordsman, after a bloody and long-enduring fight, so
thoroughly vanquished the Spaniard, that the king, who delighted
in such encounters, and who was especially glad when victory was
won by the side he most favored, not only restored to Sir Robert
the forfeited paternal estates, but he also authorized him to wear
the arms of the much-bruised knight from beyond sea.</p>

<p>At a later period knightly estates went in the service of another
king. Sir Henry Cary risked life and property in the cause of
Charles I., and while he preserved the first, he was deprived of
nearly all the latter. The head of the family, no longer a knight,
if I remember rightly, was residing at Torr Bay, when the Old
Chevalier was about to attempt to regain the three crowns which,
according to no less than a French archiepiscopal authority,
James II. had been simple enough to lose for one mass. At this
period, the English king that would be, sent the Duke of Ormond
to the head of the Cary family, and not only conveyed to him an
assurance that his services to the Stuarts had not been forgotten;
but, by way of guarantee that future, and perhaps more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</span>
knightly honors should be heaped upon him, in case of victory declaring
for the Stuart cause, the chevalier sent him the portraits
of James II., and of that monarch’s wife, Mary of Modena. Similar
portraits are to be found among the cherished treasures of
many English families; and these are supposed to have been originally
distributed among various families, as pledges from the giver,
that for swords raised, money lost, or blood shed in the cause of
the Stuarts, knighthood and honors more substantial should follow
as soon as “the king” should “get his own again.”</p>

<p>To revert to Charles I., it may be added that he was not half
so energetic in trying to keep his own as his grandson was in trying
to recover what had been lost. An incident connected with
the battle of Rowton Heath will serve to exemplify this. Never
did king have better champion than Charles had on that day, in
the able knight Sir Marmaduke Langdale. The knight in question
had gained a marked advantage over his adversary, the
equally able Poyntz. To cheer the king, then beleaguered in
Chester Castle, with the news, Sir Marmaduke despatched Colonel
Shakerley. He could not have commissioned a better man. The
colonel contrived to get into Chester after crossing the Dee in a
tub, which he worked with one hand, while he towed his horse
after him with the other. He delivered his message, and offered
to convey an answer or instructions back to Sir Marmaduke, and
by the same means, in a quarter of an hour. The king hesitated;
some sanction required for a certain course of action proposed by
Sir Marmaduke was not given, and Poyntz recovered his lost
ground, defeated the royal horse, and thus effectually prevented
Charles from obtaining access to Scotland and Montrose.</p>

<p>I have given some illustrations of the means by which knighthood
was occasionally gained: an amusing illustration remains to
be told. Dangeau, in his memoirs, speaks of two French peeresses
who lived chiefly upon asses’ milk, but who, nevertheless,
became afflicted with some of the ills incident to humanity, and
were ordered to take physic. They were disgusted with the prescription,
but got over the difficulty charmingly by physicking the
donkey. It was not an unusual thing in France for very great
people to treat their vices as they did their ailments, by a vicarious
treatment. Catherine de Medicis is one out of many instances of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</span>
this. She was desirous of succeeding in some great attempt, and
set down her failure to the account of her sins. She instantly declared
that she would atone for the latter, provided her desires
were accomplished, by finding a pilgrim who would go from France
to Jerusalem, on foot, and who at every three steps he advanced
should go back one. The wished-for success was achieved, and
after some difficulty a pilgrim was found, strong enough, and sufficiently
persevering to perform the pilgrimage. The royal pledge
was redeemed, and there only remained to reward the pilgrim,
who was a soldier from the neighborhood of Viterbo. Some say
he was a merchant; but merchant or soldier, Catherine knighted,
ennobled, and enriched him. His arms were a cross and a branch
of palm tree. We are not told if he had a motto. It, at all
events, could not have been <i>nulla vestigia retrorsum</i>. They who
affirm that the pilgrim was a merchant, declare that his descendants
lost their nobility by falling again into commercial ways—a
course which was considered very derogatory, and indeed,
degrading, in those exclusive days.</p>

<p>I may mention here that Heraldry has, after all, very unfairly
treated many of the doers of great deeds. No person below the
degree of a knight could bear a cognizance of his own. Thus,
many a squire may have outdone his master in bravery; and indeed,
many a simple soldier may have done the same, but the
memory of it could not go down to posterity, because the valiant
actor was not noble enough to be worthy of distinction. In our
English army, much the same rule still obtains. Illustrious incompetence
is rewarded with “orders,” but plain John Smith, who
has captured a gun with his own hands, receives a couple of sovereigns,
which only enable him to degrade himself by getting drunk
with his friends. Our heraldic writers approve of this dainty way
of conferring distinctions. An anonymous author of a work on
Heraldry and Chivalry, published at Worcester “sixty years
since,” says—“We must consider that had heraldry distributed
its honors indiscriminately, and with too lavish a hand, making no
distinction between gentry and plebeians, the glory of arms would
have been lost, and their lustre less refulgent.”</p>

<p>But it is clear that the rule which allowed none to bear cognizance
who was not of the rank of a knight, was sometimes infringed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</span>
Thus, when Edward the Black Prince made the stout
Sir James Audley, his own especial knight, with an annuity of
five hundred marks, for gallant services at Poictiers, Audley
divided the annuity among his four squires, Delves, Dutton, Foulthurst,
and Hawkeston, and also gave them permission to wear his
own achievements, in memory of the way in which they had kept
at his side on the bloody day of Poictiers.</p>

<p>The fashion of different families wearing the same devices had,
however, its inconveniences. Thus, it happened that at this very
battle of Poictiers, or a little before it, Sir John Chandos reconnoitring
the French army, fell in with the Seigneur de Clerment,
who was reconnoitring the English army. Each saw that the
device on the upper vestment of his adversary was the same as
his own, blue worked with rays of gold round the border. They
each fell to sharp, and not very courteous words. The French
lord at length remarked that Sir John’s claim to wear the device
was just like “the boastings of you English. You can not invent
anything new,” added the angry French knight, “but when you
stumble on a pretty novelty, you forthwith appropriate it.” After
more angry words they separated, vowing that in next day’s fight,
they would make good all their assertions.</p>

<p>As the general rule was, that squires could not bear a cognizance,
so also was it a rule that knights should only fight with
their equals.</p>

<p>It is in allusion to this rule that Don Quixote says to Sancho
Panza: “Friend Sancho, for the future, whenever thou perceivest
us to be any way abused by such inferior fellows, thou art not to
expect that I should offer to draw my sword against them; for I
will not do it in the least; no, do thou then draw and chastise them
as thou thinkest fit; but if any knight come to take their part,
then will I be sure to step in between thee and danger.”</p>

<p>Knights, as I have said, have had honor conferred on them for
very strange reasons, in many countries, but in none for slighter
reasons, perhaps, than in France. We may probably except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</span>
Belgium; for there is a living knight there, who obtained his
order of chivalry for his pleasant little exhibition of gallantry in
furnishing new-laid eggs every morning at the late queen’s table,
when every hen but his, in the suburban village of Laecken had
ceased to lay!</p>

<p>Dumas, in his “Salvandire,” satirically illustrates how knights
were occasionally made in the days of Louis XIV. The hero of
that dashing romance finds himself a captive in the prison of Fort
l’Evêque; and as the king will not grant him permission to leave,
he resolves to leave without permission. He makes the attempt
by night, descends from the window in the dark, is caught by the
thigh on a spike, and is ultimately carried to a cell and a bed
within his prison-walls. The following day the governor waits
upon him, and questions him upon the motives for his dangerous
enterprise. The good governor’s curiosity is founded solely on
his anxiety to elicit from the prisoner, that the desire of the latter
to escape was not caused by his dissatisfaction with any of the
prison arrangements, whether of discipline or diet. The captive
signs a certificate to that effect, adding, that his sole motive for
endeavoring to set himself free, was because he had never done
anything to deserve that he should be put under restraint. A few
days after, the governor announces to the recluse that the certificate
of the latter has had an excellent effect. Roger supposes
that it has gained him his liberty; but the governor complacently
remarks that it has done better than that, and that the king, in
acknowledgment of the strict character of the governor’s surveillance,
has created him chevalier of the order of St. Louis. If
all the prisoners had succeeded in escaping, as nearly as Roger,
the governor would probably have been made Knight of the Holy
Ghost! The king of France had many such faithful servants;
but history affords many examples of a truer fidelity than this;
particularly the old romances and legendary history—examples
of faithfulness even after death; but, though there may be many
more romantic in those chronicles, I doubt if there is any one so
touching as the proof of fidelity which a knighted civilian, Sir
Thomas Meautis, gave of his affection for Lord Bacon, to whom
that ancient servant of the great lawyer, erected a monument at
his own cost. Hamond Lestrange relates a curious incident, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</span>
show that these two were not divided even after death. “Sir
Thomas,” says Lestrange, “was not nearer to him living than
dead; for this Sir Thomas ending his life about a score of years
after, it was his lot to be inhumed so near his lord’s sepulchre,
that in the forming of his grave, part of the viscount’s body was
exposed to view; which being espied by a doctor of physic, he
demanded the head to be given to him; and did most shamefully
disport himself with that skull which was somewhile the continent
of so vast treasures of knowledge.”</p>

<p>Other knights have been celebrated for other qualities. Thus,
Sir Julius Cæsar never heard Bishop Hackett preach without
sending him a piece of money. Indeed, the good knight never
heard any preacher deliver a sermon without sending him money,
a pair of gloves, or some other little gift. He was unwilling, he
said, to hear the Word of God, gratis.</p>

<p>Other knights have cared less to benefit preachers, than to set
up for makers or explainers of doctrines themselves. Thus the
Chevalier Ramsay held that Adam and Eve begot the entire
human race in Paradise, the members of which fell with their procreators;
and in this way the chevalier found in an intelligible
form “the great, ancient, and luminous doctrine of our co-existence
with our first parents.” The Chevalier deemed that in
teaching such doctrine he was rearing plants for a new Paradise;
but he was not half so usefully engaged as some brother knights
who were practically engaged as planters. We may cite Sir
John St. Aubyn, who introduced plane-trees into Cornwall in
1723; and Sir Anthony Ashley, the Dorchester knight, who
enjoys the reputation of having introduced cabbages into England
about the middle of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>In contrast with these useful knights, the person of the once
famous Chevalier de Lorenzi seems to rise before me, and of him
I will now add a few words, by way of conclusion to my miscellaneous
volume.</p>

<p>It is perhaps the tritest of platitudes to say that men are distinguished
by various qualities; but it is among the strangest if
not most novel of paradoxes, that the same man should be remarkable
for endowments of the most opposite quality. The eccentric
knight whose name and title I have given above, is, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</span>
an illustration of the fact; namely, that a man may be at
once stupid and witty. It was chiefly for his stupidity that Lorenzi
was famous, a stupidity which excited laughter. I must,
nevertheless, say in behalf of the brother of the once celebrated
minister of France at the Court of Florence, in the days of
Louis XV., that his stupidity so often looks like wit, as to induce
the belief that it was a humor too refined for his hearers to appreciate.</p>

<p>Acute as Grimm was, he seems to have undervalued the chevalier
in this respect. That literary minister-plenipotentiary of the
Duke of Saxe Gotha could only see in the chevalier the most extraordinary
of originals. He acknowledges, at the same time,
Lorenzi’s high feeling of honor, and his frank and gentle spirit.
The chevalier was crammed with scientific knowledge, but so confusedly
that, according to Grimm, he could never explain himself
in an intelligible way, or without exciting shouts of laughter on
the part of his hearers. Madame de Geoffrin, when comparing
the chevalier with the ungraceful M. de Burigny, said that the
latter was awkward in body, but that Lorenzi was awkward in
mind. As the latter never spoke without, at least, an air of profound
reflection, and had therewith a piquant Florentine accent,
his mistakes were more relished. I do not think much of his misapprehension
when introduced, at Lyons, to M. de la Michaudière,
in whose company he dined, at the residence of the commandant
of the city. The gentleman was addressed by an old acquaintance
as Le Michaudière, and Lorenzi, mistaking this for L’Ami Chaudière,
persisted in calling the dignified official by the appellation
of Monsieur <i>Chaudière</i>, which, to the proud <i>intendant</i> of Lyons,
must have been as bad as if the chevalier had certified that the
<i>intendant’s</i> father was a brazier.</p>

<p>He was far more happy, whether by chance or design, I can
not say, at a subsequent supper at M. de la Michaudière’s house.
At the table sat M. le Normant, husband of Madame de Pompadour,
then at the height of her brilliant infamy. Lorenzi hearing
from a neighbor, in reply to an inquiry, that the gentleman was
the consort of the lady in question, forthwith addressed him as
Monsieur de Pompadour, which was as severe an infliction as
husband so situated could well have endured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</span></p>

<p>This honorable chevalier was clearly not a religious man—but
among knights and other distinguished personages in France,
and elsewhere, at the period of which I am treating, the two terms
were perfectly distinct, and had no necessary connection. Accordingly,
a lady who had called on Lorenzi one Sunday morning,
before eleven o’clock, proposed, at the end of their conversation,
to go with him to mass. “Do they still celebrate mass?” asked
the chevalier, with an air of astonishment. As he had not attended
mass for fifteen years, Grimm gravely asserts that the Florentine
imagined that it was no longer celebrated. “The more,” adds
the epistolary baron, “that as he never went out before two
o’clock, he no longer recollected that he had seen a church-door
open.”</p>

<p>The chevalier, who was Knight of the Order of St. Stephen of
Tuscany, and who had withdrawn from the French Army, with
the rank of colonel, after the conquest of Minorca, had a great
devotion toward the abstract sciences. He studied geometry and
astronomy, and had the habit, says Grimm, to measure the events
of life, and reduce them to geometrical value. As he was
thoughtful, he more frequently, when addressed, made reply to
abstruse questionings of his own brain than to persons who
spoke to him. Grimm, after saying that the Knight of St. Stephen
was only struck by the true or false side of a question, and never
by its pleasant or amusing aspect, illustrates his saying by an anecdote,
in which many persons will fail to find any remarkable
point. Grimm encountered him at Madame Geoffrin’s, after his
return from a tour in Italy. “I saw him embroiling his senses
with the genealogies of two ladies in whose society he passes his
life, and who bear the same name, although they are of distinct
families. Madame Geoffrin endeavored to draw him from these
genealogical snares, observing to him:—‘Really, chevalier, you
are in your dotage. It is worse than ever.’ ‘Madame,’ answered
the chevalier, ‘life is so short!’” Grimm thought he should have
done rank injustice to posterity if he had not recorded this reply
for the benefit of future students of laconic wit. And again:—Grimm
shows us the chevalier walking with Monsieur de St.
Lambert toward Versailles. On the way, the latter asked him
his age. “I am sixty,” said the knight. “I did not think you so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</span>
old,” rejoined his friend. “Well,” replied the chevalier, “when
I say sixty, I am not indeed quite so old, just yet; but—” “But
how old are you then, in reality?” asked his companion. “Fifty-five,
exactly; but why may I not be allowed to accustom myself
to change my age every year, as I do my shirt?”</p>

<p>One day, he was praising the figure of a lady, but instead of
saying that she had the form of a nymph, he said that her shape
was like that of Mademoiselle Allard. “Oh!” cried Grimm,
“you are not lucky, chevalier, in your comparison. Mademoiselle
Allard may be deservedly eulogized for many qualities, but nobody
ever thought of praising her shape.” “Likely enough,” said
Lorenzi, “for I do not know, nor, indeed, have I ever seen her;
but as everybody talks about Mademoiselle Allard, I thought I
might talk about her too.”</p>

<p>If there was satire in this it was not of so neat a quality as
that exhibited by him at Madame Greffon’s, where he was spending
an evening with Grimm and D’Alembert. The last two were
seated, and conversing. Lorenzi stood behind them, with his back
to the chimney-piece, and scarcely able to hold up his head, so
overcome was he by a desire to sleep. “Chevalier,” said Grimm,
“you must find our conversation a horrid bore, since you fall
asleep when you are on your legs.” “Oh, no!” exclaimed the
chevalier, “you see I go to sleep when I like.” The naïveté
with which he insinuated that he liked to go to sleep rather than
listen to the small talk of a wit and a philosopher, was expressed
with a delicious delicacy.</p>

<p>Of his <i>non-sequential</i> remarks Grimm supplies several. He
was once speaking disparagingly of M. de St. Lambert’s knowledge
of chess. “You forget,” said the latter, “that I gained
fifteen louis to your thirty sous, during our campaign in Minorca.”
“Oh, ay,” answered the knight, “but that was toward the end of
the siege!”</p>

<p>It was at this siege that he used to go to the trenches with
his astronomical instruments, to make observations. He one day
returned to his quarters without his instruments, having left
them all in the trenches. “They will certainly be stolen,” said a
friend. “That can’t be,” said Lorenzi, “for I left my watch with
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</span></p>

<p>And yet this “distraught” knight was the cause, remote cause,
of the death of Admiral Byng. He discovered, by mere chance,
in his quarters at Minorca, a book of signals as used by the English
fleet. He hastened with it to the Prince de Beaubeau, who,
in his turn, hastened to place it before the Marshal de Richelieu.
The commanders could scarcely believe in their good fortune, but
when the naval combat commenced it was seen that the English
observed this system of signals exactly. With this knowledge
it was easy to anticipate all their manœuvres, and they were obliged
to withdraw with disgrace, which Byng was made to
expiate by his death. The chevalier never thought of asking
for a reward, and his government entirely forgot to give
him one.</p>

<p>When about to accompany M. de Mirepoix, who was appointed
embassador to London, he packed up his own things and that so
perfectly that it was not till he had sent them off that he discovered
he had left himself nothing to travel in but the shirt and
robe-de-chambre which he wore while employed in thus disposing
of the rest of his wardrobe.</p>

<p>He lived in a small apartment at the Luxembourg, as persons
of like rank and small means reside in the royal palace at Hampton
Court. One day, on descending the staircase he slipped, and
broke his nose. On looking round for the cause of his accident,
he observed a whitish fluid on the steps; and, calling the porter,
he rated him soundly for allowing this soapy water to remain on
the staircase. “It is <i>barley</i> water,” said the porter, “which a
waiter from the café spilled as he carried it along.” “Oh! if
that be the case,” replied the chevalier, in a mild tone, and with
his hand up to his mutilated nose, “if that be the case, it is I who
am in the wrong.”</p>

<p>Grimm adds, in summing up his character, that he was richer
in pocket handkerchiefs than any other man. As his apartment
was just under the roof of the palace, and that he, almost every
day on going out, forgot to take a handkerchief with him, he
found it less trouble to buy a new than to ascend to his room and
procure an old one. Accordingly, a mercer in his neighborhood
had a fresh handkerchief ready for him every day.</p>

<p>The history of eccentric knights would make a volume of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</span>
itself. Here, therefore, I will conclude, grateful to the readers
who may have honored me by perusing any portion of the miscellaneous
pages which I have devoted to illustrations of chivalry,
and, adding a remark of Johnson, who says, touching the respect
paid to those who bear arms, that “The naval and military
professions have the dignity of danger, and that mankind
reverence those who have got over fear, which is so general a
weakness.”</p>

<p>This is a series of volumes which has been undertaken with a view to supply
the want of a class of books for children, of a vigorous, manly tone, combined
with a plain and concise mode of narration. The writings of Charles Dickens
have been selected as the basis of the scheme, on account of the well-known
excellence of his portrayal of children, and the interests connected with children—qualities
which have given his volumes their strongest hold on the
hearts of parents. With this view the career of <span class="smcap">Little Nell</span> and her
<span class="smcap">Grandfather</span>, <span class="smcap">Oliver</span>, <span class="smcap">Little Paul</span>, <span class="smcap">Florence Dombey</span>, <span class="smcap">Smike</span>, and
the <span class="smcap">Child-Wife</span>, have been detached from the large mass of matter with
which they were originally connected, and presented, <i>in the author’s own language</i>,
to a new class of readers, to whom the little volume will, we doubt
not, be as attractive as the larger originals have so long proved to the general
public.</p>

<p class="c sp"><b>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</b></p>

<p>“The author of ‘Lorenzo Benoni’ is <span class="smcap">Giovanni Ruffini</span>, a native of Genoa, who effected
his escape from his native country after the attempt at revolution in 1833. His book is,
in substance, an authentic account of real persons and incidents, though the writer has
chosen to adopt fictitious and fantastic designations for himself and his associates. Since
1833, Ruffini has resided chiefly (if not wholly) in England and France, where his qualities,
we understand, have secured him respect and regard. In 1848, he was selected by
Charles Albert to fill the responsible situation of embassador to Paris, in which city he
had long been domesticated as a refugee. He ere long, however, relinquished that office,
and again withdrew into private life. He appears to have employed the time of his exile
in this country to such advantage as to have acquired a most uncommon mastery over
the English language. The present volume (we are informed on good authority) is exclusively
his own—and, if so, on the score of style alone it is a remarkable curiosity.
But its matter also is curious.”—<i>London Quarterly Review for July.</i></p>

<p>“A tale of sorrow that has lain long in a rich mind, like a ruin in a fertile country, and
is not the less gravely impressive for the grace and beauty of its coverings ... at the
same time the most determined novel-reader could desire no work more fascinating over
which to forget the flight of time.... No sketch of foreign oppression has ever, we believe,
been submitted to the English public by a foreigner, equal or nearly equal to this
volume in literary merit. It is not unworthy to be ranked among contemporary works
whose season is the century in which their authors live.”—<i>London Examiner.</i></p>

<p>“The book should be as extensively read as ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin,’ inasmuch as it
develops the existence of a state of slavery and degradation, worse even than that which
Mrs. Beecher Stowe has elucidated with so much pathos and feeling.”—<i>Bell’s Weekly
Messenger.</i></p>

<p>“Few works of the season will be read with greater pleasure than this; there is a
great charm in the quiet, natural way in which the story is told.”—<i>London Atlas.</i></p>

<p>“The author’s great forte is character-painting. This portraiture is accomplished
with remarkable skill, the traits both individual and national being marked with great
nicety without obtrusiveness.”—<i>London Spectator.</i></p>

<p>“Under the modest guise of the biography of an imaginary ‘Lorenzo Benoni,’ we have
here, in fact, the memoir of a man whose name could not be pronounced in certain parts
of northern Italy without calling up tragic yet noble historical recollections ... its
merits, simply as a work of literary art, are of a very high order. The style is really
beautiful—easy, sprightly, graceful, and full of the happiest and most ingenious turns of
phrase and fancy.”—<i>North British Review.</i></p>

<p>“This has been not unjustly compared to ‘<i>Gil Blas</i>,’ to which it is scarcely inferior in
spirited delineations of human character, and in the variety of events which it relates.
But as a description of actual occurrences illustrating the domestic and political condition
of Italy, at a period fraught with interest to all classes of readers, it far transcends
in importance any work of mere fiction.”—<i>Dublin Evening Mail.</i></p>

<p>The following, being a few of the more prominent names introduced in
the work, will show the nature and extent of personal and anecdotal interest
exhibited in its pages:—</p>

<p>Aaron Burr; General Jackson; John Jacob Astor; Stephen Girard;

Swartwout; Lord Aberdeen; Peter K. Wagner; Napoleon; Paul

Emperor Alexander, etc. etc.</p>

<p>“He seldom looks at the bright side of a character, and dearly loves—he
confesses it—a bit of scandal. But he paints well, describes well, seizes
characteristics which make clear to the reader the nature of the man whom
they illustrate.”</p>

<p class="less">The memoirs of a man of a singularly adventurous and speculative turn, who entered
upon the occupations of manhood early, and retained its energies late; has been an eye-witness
of not a few of the important events that occurred in Europe and America between
the years 1796 and 1850, and himself a sharer in more than one of them; who has
been associated, or an agent in some of the largest commercial and financial operations
that British and Dutch capital and enterprise ever ventured upon, and has been brought
into contact and acquaintance—not unfrequently into intimacy—with a number of the
remarkable men of his time. Seldom, either in print or in the flesh, have we fallen in
with so restless, versatile and excursive a genius as Vincent Nolte, Esq., of Europe and
America—no more limited address will sufficiently express his cosmopolitan domicile.—<i>Blackwood’s
Magazine.</i></p>

<p class="less">As a reflection of real life, a book stamped with a strong personal character, and filled
with unique details of a large experience of private and public interest, we unhesitatingly
call attention to it as one of the most note-worthy productions of the day.—<i>New
York Churchman.</i></p>

<p class="less">Our old merchants and politicians will find it very amusing, and it will excite vivid
reminiscences of men and things forty years ago. We might criticise the hap-hazard
and dare-devil spirit of the author, but the raciness of his anecdotes is the result of these
very defects.—<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p class="less">His autobiography presents a spicy variety of incident and adventure, and a great deal
of really useful and interesting information, all the more acceptable for the profusion of
anecdote and piquant scandal with which it is interspersed.—<i>N. Y. Jour. of Commerce.</i></p>

<p class="less">Not the least interesting portion of the work, to us here, is the narration of Nolte’s
intercourse with our great men, and his piquant and occasionally ill-natured notice of
their faults and foibles.—<i>N. Y. Herald.</i></p>

<p class="less">It is a vivid chronicle of varied and remarkable experiences, and will serve to rectify
the errors which too often pass among men as veritable history.—<i>Evening Post.</i></p>

<p class="less">The anecdotes, declamations, sentiments, descriptions, and whole tone of the book,
are vivacious and genuine, and, making allowance for obvious prejudices, graphic and
reliable. To the old it will be wonderfully suggestive, to the young curiously informing,
and to both rich in entertainment.—<i>Boston Atlas.</i></p>

<p class="less">As an amusing narrative, it would be difficult to find its superior; but the book has
peculiar interest from the freedom with which the author shows up our American notorieties
of the past forty years.—<i>Courier.</i></p>

<p class="c sp xlarge p2">THE UNITED STATES JAPAN EXPEDITION.</p>


<p><span class="up">An Account of Three Visits to the Japanese</span>
Empire, with Sketches of Madeira, St. Helena, Cape of Good
Hope, Mauritius, Ceylon, Singapore, China, and Loo-Choo.
By Col. <span class="smcap">J. W. Spalding</span>, of the United States Steam Frigate
Mississippi, Flag-ship of the Expedition, with eight Illustrations
in Tint. 12mo., cloth, $1 25.</p>

<p class="less">The book embraces a novel field in “Japan,” and a wide one in the world, but the
author has made a long voyage seem a short one, in the interest which his graphic and
instructive pen has thrown about every league of his progress. The style is flowing
and animated—Japan and the Japanese are dashed off in life-like pictures. We advise
all who have the slightest curiosity to become acquainted with that secluded and remarkable
people, and to obtain a connected and spirited account of the great American
Expedition to Japan, to purchase the admirable work of Col. Spalding.—<i>Rich. Dispatch.</i></p>

<p class="less">Col. Spalding is a man whose character in the community in which he has heretofore
resided places him above suspicion, so that his narrative may be implicitly trusted. He
is withal a racy writer, and a person gifted with very uncommon powers of observation.—<i>Baltimore
Patriot.</i></p>

<p class="less">It describes all that the intelligent author saw, in a clear and very agreeable manner,
and mentions many things of a personal character, which, of course, would form no
part of an official report.—<i>Baltimore American.</i></p>

<p class="less">There is a freshness and vividness in his descriptions which makes the book more than
commonly attractive.—<i>Puritan Recorder.</i></p>

<p class="less">Mr. Spalding writes with great ease and perspicuity. His powers of description are
fully adequate to any occasion which requires their exertion, as is abundantly evidenced
in the present work.—<i>Petersburg Intelligencer.</i></p>

<p class="less">A very readable journal of the Japan Expedition, by an officer which, though aiming
only at re-producing the impressions of the writer’s mind, gives a good view of the
strange scenes and characters which the opening of that country disclosed.—<i>N. Y. Evan.</i></p>

<p class="less">Mr. Spalding’s work gives the results of his observations precisely as they occurred to
him at the time, his mind being singularly unbiassed by the enthusiasm of those by
whom he was surrounded. He looks upon things with a cool, discriminating eye, neither
over-estimating nor undervaluing the advantages of our new relations.—<i>N. Y. Herald.</i></p>

<p class="less">It is the first account of Perry’s Expedition, and will always be more popular than
any government report.—<i>St. Louis Leader.</i></p>

Nussir-u-Deen, King of Oude. By <span class="smcap">Wm. Knighton</span>, author of
“Forest Life in Ceylon,” &amp;c. 12mo., cloth, 75 cents.</p>

<p class="less">The whole story reads like a lost chapter from the Arabian Nights.—<i>Lon. Athenæum.</i></p>

<p class="less">Gives a better insight into purely eastern manners than any work we know of.—<i>London
News of the World.</i></p>

<p class="less">This amusing volume lets the reader very much behind the scenes, as regards haut
ton in Asia. Since the appearance of the Arabian Nights, there has been no such exposition
of the sayings and doings of eastern royalty.—<i>N. Y. Daily Times.</i></p>

<p class="less">Lucknow, the capital, is noted for its extraordinary menagerie of wild animals, and
one of the chief amusements of the court appears to have been to witness them fight.
Some very exciting contests are narrated, and the book contains much of interest to the
sportsman. It also conveys a vivid picture of eastern manners, as seen in all their familiarity;
and some of the adventures recorded are scarcely less wonderful than those of
Hajji Baba.—<i>Boston Traveller.</i></p>

<p class="less">The career of the cabin-boy barber, who exercised such great influence over the crown,
and so much to his own advantage, having amassed the sum of £240,000 before he returned,
is a very curious one, and well told. On the whole, this is one of the most
amusing books of the season.—<i>Boston Telegraph.</i></p>

<p class="less">He lifts the curtain and unfolds the minutiæ of the daily life of an absolute sovereign.
We learn more of eastern manners and Hindoo peculiarities than from stately historians
or elaborate geographies. We can commend it as an entertaining volume.—<i>Religious
Herald Richmond. Va.</i></p>
